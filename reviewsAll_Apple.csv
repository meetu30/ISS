ALFALIH,"[15,18]","I have had this little miracle for a couple of weeks and I absolutely love it, in fact I take it with me anywhere I go. Alot fo people are negative about this product because of it's lack of a DVD drive and an ethernet port, I very very rarely use them so it fits me just fine. You should note that the Air was not intended as an all in one computing solution but as an extension of your system. An iMac and Macbook Air would fit perfectely together for around the price of the MacBook Pro.The fit and finish is spectacular, it feels light yet solid. Other laptops in this weight range feel flimsy, none of that here.Performance is much better than i had anticipated, the 2GB of ram really do make a diference. It does suffer with very very high resolution 1080P videos but other than that it's pretty snappy. Much more so than any other portable in its range.I would recomened you stick to this configuration, the higher processor is not worth the extra 300 USD and the SSD drive is definately not worth an extra 1K!!!What are you waiting for? add the damn thing to your cart already!!!",5,Fantastic little laptop!!!,03/03/2008

""lovetotweet""","[5,5]","I cannot begin to describe how much I love this laptop!  I won't provide a technical review as I am sure other reviewers are much more competent to do so.  I purchased this laptop for work and graduate school as soon as they came out.  I first switched to Apple about 3 years ago, and since that time I have owned a PowerBook G4 12"" which I traded up for the MacBook Pro 15"" and decided it was too big (can you tell I want something small?).  So, when the MacBook Air came out, I gave my husband my Pro and purchased this.  I couldn't be more satisfied with it.  It is fast, well-constructed and lightweight with a beautiful, clear screen, all of which are essentials for my computer happiness!  The touchpad is awesome...I find myself wishing that my iMac mouse had a similar feature.  I do not find the lack of an optical drive problematic; I purchased the $99 external drive and, as I said, also have an iMac, so program installation, CD uploading, etc., is not a problem for me.  The external drive is also small enough that you can pack it up in your case and bring it with you if need be.  The battery life is fantastic: I can take class notes for 3 hours straight and still have plenty of juice for another hour or two of use...if I had to estimate battery time, I'd say it consistently gives me 4 1/2 to 5 hours of use.  I do not do a lot of video editing or gaming, etc., but I do use this for way more than email, including tons of writing, business uses, and web design.  It isn't the task master that the Pro's are, but it's convenience makes up for any shortcomings.  So, it basically comes down to what works for you, and because my primary computer is an iMac, the portability, speed, and ease of use of the MacBook Air is a great choice.",5,Completely Amazing!,06/18/2008

I do own a first generation MacBook Pro and was honestly tempted at first to bring it along in case I need ""it"". ""It"" mainly referred to the DVD drive, built-in ethernet and perhaps superior hard-drive speed/access time. I decided to go with the MacBook Air alone (and the USB ethernet adapter) - and see what happens.It went great. First of all, the bag on my shoulder felt almost unreasonably light. Battery life was more than sufficient to support my three-hour flight with about 25% of capacity left at the end. Connecting to the internet at the airport (via wi-fi) and in the hotel (USB-ethernet adapter) was a breeze (note, however, that I did need the $29 USB-ethernet adapter).At the conference, laptop-envy abounded... quite amazing, actually. The reaction of someone who has never seen it to its size, sturdiness, and form factor is quite impressive.I ichatted with my family without problems with good quality video; the systems overall felt a bit more responsive than my 2-year old MacBook Pro with the first-generation Core Duo chip.If you want a light, thin, sturdy laptop with full-size keyboard, a gorgeous screen, MacOS X (10.5), and you don't necessarily need a CD/DVD drive (you can buy an external one, but somehow lugging this extra piece around somehow defies the purpose of the MBA), and can put up with not ""optimal"" hard-drive performance, then the MBA is exactly what you want!I would buy the USB-ethernet adapter, though.If you need high-speed performance, FireWire, a high-end graphics card, a built-in DVD/CD drive etc, then the MBA is not for you - but I guess then you would not be looking at this page...;)Honestly, I could not be happier with my purchase. My MB Pro will be up on eBay soon...Update:I have been using my MacBook Air now for 4 weeks and have taken it on several trips. This now allows me to update some of the comments made before.- Battery life: I am quite happy with the battery life which easily allows 3-4 hours of text processing, PowerPoint slide generation, and EndNote work. For me this mainly happens on flights which allows to lower the brightness of the LED screen to save power. I have not pushed my MBA to play videos. In fact, I have no digital entertainment files on it since these files can fill up the (limited) space on the drive quite fast.- Ports: One USB port is not enough! For instance, if you have to connect to the internet via USB adapter (again, still indispensable!), you block the one and only USB port - unless you carry a USB hub along (Belkin has a nice 4-port one with a swivel design, but quite pricey). Thus, I have added a small USB hub to my travel utensils.- Design: The MBA still turns heads and sparks comments. In fact, on one of my flights the captain himself left the cockpit to take a look after one of the flight attendants had told him about the MBA on my lap...- Heat: The MBA is MUCH cooler than my MacBook Pro. You can easily keep it on your lap without feeling uncomfortable.My wish list for future MBA generations:- At least 2 USB ports. Should be easy to do.- Reconsider built-in ethernet - the USB adapter works fine, but blocks the one USB port at this point.- As soon as larger 1.8'' drives (HD or SSD) are available, they will surely find its way into the MBA to overcome some space limitations.- It might surprise some, but I honestly do not see a great need for a swapable battery. I would leave it as is in order to keep the amazing form factor.",5,I own a MacBook Air... (update),02/16/2008

I was so pleased with it - great graphics, the ""cool"" factor, perfect for all I needed it for (as a writer and photographer, the storage was excellent and the application were perfect).However, after having it for only six months, I noticed the screen was wobbling back and forth alarmingly. I was more gentle with it than before - this computer needs a lot of TLC, the lid scratches easily and the screen must be cleaned regularly for fear of the dreaded ""fingerprint"" marks.In about December, the screen was now wobbling up and down AND side to side. I was very worried about it, but I needed the laptop for my work and studies. I didn't think it was really a problem though, as I had been assured the design was ""robust"".Then in April 2009 the right side hinge snapped. I was shuttin the screen as I usually do and I heard a loud ""snap"". I tried to open it once to see if the hardware still worked, and found that everything was in order. It appeared that the hinge had broken through the plastic inverter which joins the base to the lid. I took it into the Apple store here and they informed me that they wouldn't cover it unless I could find the receipt which showed I had paid the tax on the laptop. The next few months were spent trying to track the thing down, and yesterday, when I took it to two separate Apple stores who told me that, whether it was under warranty or not, Apple would not fix the hinge under it as they classed it as ""user damage"". I dare anyone to type in the words ""Macbook Air hinge"" into Google and see the problems with the hinge. There are so many people with the same problem that it can't be a coincidence. I live in South Africa, and the Apple stores here state that Apple itself have sent out a blanket statement to ALL Apple stores saying the hinge is classed as ""user damage"". That very action shows the amount of complaints they must have had regarding this problem. The MBA is a rare computer in South Africa, which adds to the controversy.Apparently, I have seen that the second version of this MBA (the Revolution B) has a different hinge contraption on it, showing that Apple must know about the fault.So, beware if you want to buy this laptop. The technical specs are great (baring the lack of DVD drive, FW and only one USB port - but if you wanted that, then why buy a ""cool"" computer) and the running speeds are brilliant. However, this issue is simply with Apple's customer service with something which is not the user's fault which I have issue with here. Make sure you buy the Revolution B laptop if you can.On a side note? It'll take R7000 to fix the hinge (the screen and hinge are joined), which I can't afford. That's half the price of the entire laptop. So I'm probably going to buy a different Macbook, one that isn't as powerful but is thicker, sturdier with a DVD RW incorperated.",2,Great computer but faulty hinge,08/19/2009

I need to emphasize that I LOVE MBA design. First, 80GB is so small that you will see more than 1/2 of 80GB is required by OS, VM and major applications. Performance is getting even slower due to its storage bottleneck. At least two USBs and Ethernet are must. It is sacrificing flexibility so much to reduce its size and weight but I do not feel it does not have a fair balance for regular users. I still encounter occasional blackout and freeze problem when I leave it for a few hours, which has not been solved even through Apple's technical support.I definitely think next one will be much better and Apple knows how we feel about MBA.

A27RT2ZHURERAU,B0006HU4DK,Apple,"Apple MacBook Air MB003LL/A 13.3 Inch Laptop (1.6 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive)",Bluesparkhitsyourbrain,"[0,0]","I did a fair amount of soul-searching before pulling the trigger on this purchase, in large part because of all the ""compromises"" apparently required to make as thin as this one is.  For me, the MBA replaced a ThinkPad T-40, which has been as sturdy, consistent, and feature-laden as it is unattractive.  My worry was that, though I was sure I would like the size and appearance of the MBA, maybe I would miss the T-40's feature set.  Worse, I might miss a particular feature while traveling.  So, I almost didn't buy the MBA.I needn't have worried -- the MBA is simply incredible.  As others have mentioned, the case is quite sturdy.  Apple's engineers ingeniously relied on some of the internal components themselves as part of the skeleton for the case.  This sounds scary, except that they were designed to serve both functions. The keyboard is crisp and comfortable (and keep in mind that I'm coming from a very well-regarded keyboard in the ThinkPad).  The trackpad gestures more than make up for all of the extra keys the ThinkPad has.  Although it takes some getting used to, the three-finger swipe, the two finger ""right-click"", pinching/expanding, etc., are all intuitive, comfortable, and fairly addictive.  I've even started missing them on my desktop.  The screen is really impressive -- a *big* improvement from my previous laptop.  And battery life has been just fine -- definitely not the advertised five hours, but consistently well over three.What do I miss? Honestly, not much.  I've started using downloaded movies when I travel, including iTunes rentals.  They all look just as good as a DVD did (on a laptop, at least) and are better for battery life.  When I use an external mouse, I use a Bluetooth wireless model, so it doesn't take up the USB port.  I was never a battery-swapper anyway, so that's not an issue.  (I'll probably gripe about the built-in battery every couple of years when I replace it, then forget it the rest of the time.)  And I can't save everything I have on the hard drive, though it holds everything that I would ever need on-the-go.  I don't even miss the Ethernet port, as I travel with an Airport Express, and have for years.  For me, the only real downside is the speed of opening applications.  Opening most apps is noticeably and annoyingly slower than with my desktop (or, presumably, than all of the other Apple notebooks).  However, once open, they do just fine.  I now leave them open, which Apple says is fine, and speed is more than adequate.As a disclaimer, I should mention that I'm a lawyer, so my usage doesn't involve heavy graphic or media work.  I tend to run the Microsoft Office suite, Safari, iTunes, iPhoto, watch movies, and use the internet.  For those types of things, the MBA comfortably meets my needs.  I've even added VM Ware's Fusion program (running Windows XP) and, once loaded, it does the job as well.  A speed demon this computer isn't, but if you use general productivity software and Apple's consumer applications, you'll probably be very happy.",5,Compromises? Not In My View.,03/17/2008
AUWS4WEQ3GS53,B0006HU4DK,Apple,"Apple MacBook Air MB003LL/A 13.3 Inch Laptop (1.6 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive)",Bill Staley,"[16,16]","I have been the informal tech guy for two Airs.  One for 8 months, one for 6 months.  I have also traveled with them.  They are generally wonderful, especially if the weight is a big factor.  All other laptops seem heavy and inelegant.  But ...(1) If you ever want to use an ethernet connection to the internet (as opposed to wireless), then you have to bring the dongle that converts the one USB port to ethernet.  For example, to check your office email at a Kinko's. Definitely buy it.  You will want to travel with this and an ethernet cable, in case your hotel room has an ethernet connection and no (or poor) wireless reception.(2) To do a quick full restore from Time Machine, you need BOTH an OSX disc (either Disc 1 that comes with the Air or an off-the-shelf OSX disc) and the back-up hard drive.  But you only have one USB port and no firewire ports.  The SuperDrive will not share that port on a USB hub (nor will it work on any computer but an Air). It is easy to back up with Time Machine to a small external drive.  (We used a Western Digital Passport.) But consider using a Time Capsule or an external hard drive that has its own power supply. The powered external drive is not elegant, but if you ever need to do a full restore (and you might because your Air will lead a hard life, especially if it is a student's life), it will save you a couple of hours if you use a powered external hard drive.  The SuperDrive that you can buy for the Air (and you should buy it, it is small and light) does not work from a USB hub.  A powered DVD drive from another manufacturer (ours is from Toshiba) works on a powered USB hub.  The WD Passport would not connect to the Air via a powered USB hub (at least through the hub I used, and that hub has had problems).  But a powered WD MyBook external hard drive did connect to the Air via the powered hub. So use a powered external hard drive for your Time Machine backups, and if you need to do a full restore, get a powered USB hub and a powered external DVD drive with a USB output.  The Apple Genius Bar might not have these.  Note: See (11) and (12) below for alternate methods for a full restore, in one of which the WD Passport worked fine.(3) The Genius Bar geniuses know a lot more about the MacBook than the Air because the Air is still relatively new.(4) If you ever do a full ""restore and erase"" from the two discs that come with the Air, you need to know this:  At the end of first disc, about 1.5 hours into the process, it flashes ""Get ready to insert Disc 2.""  Then it reboots and eventually says ""Installing. Calculating time remaining"" and ejects the disc.  It does NOT say ""Insert Disc 2"".  If maybe you were not watching it for the entire first 1.5 hours, you would not have seen the message at the end of Disc 1 before the reboot.  What it wants when it ejects Disc 1 is for you to insert Disc 2.  Not very brilliant programming.  Every two-disc Windows program and game says ""Insert Disc 2 and press Enter."" Not these install discs.  I found out when I went to the Genius bar and the Genius restarted the install process. He went to lunch and I watched the computer for two hours (this is what I want you to avoid), so I happened to see the message at the end of disc one. It was a special moment in my life.(5) Be careful where you put the Air and the SuperDrive.  I heard of someone throwing out their Air with the Sunday paper.  Might be an urban legend, but we lost a SuperDrive, possibly the same way.(6) Backups to Time Machine are more likely to happen if you use a Time Capsule as a wireless router + external hard drive.  You can also print through Time Capsule, instead of plugging the printer into the Air when you need to print.  Be sure to have the printer plugged into the Time Capsule and turned on before you install the Time Capsule.  Otherwise, you will probably need to call Apple Care to walk you through the re-install with the printer.  Don't get off the phone until the printer works and Time Machine works, not just the wireless internet.  For a student whose life is on the Air, I would definitely consider the Time Capsule an essential accessory to the Air.  For someone who uses the Air as an occasional computer for travel and has her life on an iMac with an ethernet connection to the internet, the Time Capsule is nice but not necessary.(7) Get a neoprene sleeve for the Air.  Then when it is thrown into a backpack or briefcase, it will be safer.  Also, in its sleeve on a desk it is less of an object of desire for thieves (in my humble opinion).  After all these months, the Air is still eye candy (as you well know if you got this far in this review).  Consider a color other than black, which is harder to see and find.(8) I understand that the wireless antenna is in the hinge that attaches the screen to the body of the Air.  So it is somewhat directional.  Try sliding it around to get better reception.  You can check the packet flow in the Activity Monitor in Utilities to see what works best.(9) Wireless reception does not seem to be a strength of the two Airs that I use.  The 4 MacBooks that preceded the two Airs in our lives seemed to get more consistently good wireless reception.  This is a shame, because the Air depends more on its wireless than the MacBooks, which have real ports.  In future generations of the Air I hope that Apple finds a way to get the best possible wireless reception for the Air.(10)  The 80 GB hard drive in the Air is not big enough for a student's life if the student likes to store music and videos on it.  An outboard hard drive is a distant second-best solution.  (I liked the WD Passport for this, since it does not need external power and it is small, reliable and travels well.  Consider wrapping it in bubble wrap in your backpack or briefcase.  USB power is enough for this drive since you will not be doing a full Time Machine restore from this drive.  To backup the stuff on this drive, you will need another solution, which might be Time Machine on the Time Capsule.  Update:  I attach the WD Passport and the printer to the USB port on the Time Capsule with a USB mini hub (not a powered hub), store videos on the Passport and back up the Air and Passport with Time Machine to the Time Capsule's hard drive.  I wish the backup was not in the same room as the backed-up drives, but it is a lot better than no backup.)(11) It is easy to connect the Air to another computer to use the other computer's CD or DVD drive.  You need a good wireless connection for both computers.  The Air asks the other computer for permission each time, and the other computer has to give permission each time.  I connected to another Air and could use the SuperDrive on the second Air.  I have heard of people using this as a way to access the OSX DVD when they do a quick full restore from Time Machine to the Air. I tried, could connect, but could not do a quick restore this way.  The problem was that the both the OSX disc and the original Disc 1 that comes with the Air cause a reboot.  After the reboot, the Air could not see the DVD drive in the other computer.  End of quick restore process.(12)  Update:  To do a full restore from Time Machine to the Air:  Do an Erase and Restore with the start up disc or an OSX disc.  Two hours later, when this is DONE and you have a fresh computer, it asks if you want to restore from a hard drive using Time Machine.  THEN you start the restore.  (At that point the restore process is finished with the DVD and you can unplug the SuperDrive and plug in your external hard drive, whether powered or not.  The WD Passport worked fine to restore at this point in the process.) The whole process (including the restore from Time Machine) takes many hours, but it works great and you do NOT need a powered external DVD drive; the SuperDrive works fine for this.  This waste of two hours (for the erase and restore) is the cost of a small, light computer, I guess.  Now you know, too.  I hope this saves you from the frustration thatI experienced.Given all that, every Air owner I know would buy another one if they lost theirs.  None would go back to a MacBook.  (I do know people for whom the weight is not a big issue and who want more horsepower and ports and sometimes screen size, especially for games.  They are happy with their MacBooks as their main computers.)  Except for the wireless reception, the problems of the Air are problems for the tech person, not so much for the day-to-day user.  Which is a good design choice.(Note:  Four months later: We now have two students using 80GB Airs and they both love them.  Both use external drives, too.  (WD Passports.)  My wife had her Air stolen out of an unlocked car.  Don't ask why it was unlocked.  It was in a backpack with the superdrive, ethernet dongle, external hard drive, wireless mouse, etc. and they took the backpack.  We had Lojack for Laptops on it and the LAPD got it back for us.  Just the computer, but we did not complain.  It took four weeks.  I recommend Lojack for Laptops.  The only hard part is remembering that you have Lojack on there.  The sooner you remember and file a police report, the sooner you will get your laptop back.)",4,Great + some things you might need to know,08/28/2008

As a former PC owner I appreciated the user friendliness, intuitiveness and reliability of Macs. Therefore it is with great reluctance and disappointment that I write this review of the Mac Book Air. However, let's start off with the positives. First, if you are at all familiar with Macs, I don't need to sell you on the operating system. It's awesome. `Nuff said. Another overwhelmingly positive feature is what most distinguishes the MBA from every other computer: Size. It's incredibly light, portable and surprisingly sturdy. There's no need to worry if you're wondering if this paper thin computer can handle getting tossed around in your backpack. Also, the back light for the keyboard, though superfluous, it definitely adds to that `cool' factor which is trademark of all Apple products.Now that I've gotten all the major positive elements out of the way here's the big reason why I would dissuade you from purchasing this product: Performance. When you first turn on the MBA, it performs at speeds you would expect. However, after about 30 - 45 minutes of use, it gets uncomfortably hot (if it's laying on your lap). If heat was the worst of its problems this would be a very different review, but unfortunately the problems only continue from here. With the heat the computer slows down considerably. Word processing isn't a noticeable problem, but loading software takes irritatingly more time. Internet surfing becomes a frustrating experience as pages take longer and longer to load, plus watching videos and playing on-line games becomes an excruciatingly stultifying experience.If you intend to do simple word processing work and write e-mail on a computer that's very portable then this may be the product for you, but given the price tag, there are plenty of low cost options that can deliver the same service.

I'm a college student and this was my first mac. I've always used windows since elementary. Let my start by saying that this laptop is amazingly portable. For years, I've waited for apple to release an ultraportable laptop. I was so eager to leave windows because of the crappy operating system and I always find myself waiting impatiently for my old sony vaio sz to boot because of all the antivirus programs that open before I can do anything further. However I've held back in buying a mac because the smallest laptop at that time is macbook which is an inch thick 5 lb notebook and that is not portable enough for me. After hearing the release of MBA, Immediately bought it. After 6 months of owning this laptop, I would say that it is the best computer I've ever owned.Although the specs is not that impressive. I find my laptop fast enough to handle my needs. Also, its sexiness and thinness is always a plus. it's so light and thin that I don't notice much difference when I lug it around campus in my backpack. Also,the battery life is very good.

Well I guess for those who don't mind carrying around a 6 lb portable with all the bells and whistles or an ultraportable with slow processor, small keyboard but with more ports, I guess the MBA is.Where there is no compromise is in the speed, full sized keyboard, screen clarity and battery life.  With the 64 Gig SSD and 1.8 GHZ 4MB cache processor the speed is the fastest in its class.  While the X300 is the computer that everyone loves to bash the MBA with, I will take the speed of the MBA over the DVD on the X300 anytime.  Plus, it can run both VISTA/XP and OSX.  So it is a better Vista computer and ALSO a MAC. OH and one more thing compared to the X300-you can actually buy an MBA NOW, it has been available for close to a month, while the X300 just got posted on there site and there is a more than (TYPICAL of Lenovo) 4 week ship time-usually in Lenovo jargon that means wait a few months.  It is amazing that Apple used to be the king of announce and wait has now become the company whose products are available (in most cases) on the day or within days of announcement.My only real complaint is length of time it takes to charge.  Mine is taking about 4 hours.  Hopefully there will be a firmware fix for that.The keyboard is the best in class, bar NONE, not even the X series by Lenovo.  The screen is bright and crisp.  Load times for Vista is the quickest I have seen (probably because of the SSD).I have heard complaints that there is no built in 3G or EVDO, but in my opinion, that is a waste.  Why would anyone want that built in unless that is their only computer??  As a person who has more than one laptop and computer, I much rather have a USB 3G or EVDO.

Kuhr,"[19,21]","Let me start with a simple disclaimer, first I worked for Apple (a long time ago) for 11 years, I also worked for Microsoft for 6 years and I'm pretty comfortable in both camps but I truly love Apple for it's design and combined hardware/software implementations.  I go through laptops pretty frequently and have owned UMPC's and full heavyweight desktop replacements.  Having said all that, I think the MacBook Air is a home run IF you fit the right profile.  The profile is that you want a device that you can carry around easily every day from meeting to meeting, home to work, travel, etc.  This is not the laptop for your sole machine, instead it's truly the best device I've every owned for taking notes, staying on top of email, doing some on the fly spreadsheet or database creation, watch ripped or downloaded movies, and generally working through a ""normal"" business day.  If you're looking for a game machine, power photo processing or video processing laptop, or 1 PC to suit all your needs this isn't the right product.  But for me, it's close to 100% perfect, the battery life is good enough to get me through more than a couple of meetings, I can watch a movie that I rented on iTunes or ripped on a flight, I can easily do all my email on a week long trip, and basically take the machine with me wherever I go without a big penalty in weight or size.  The display is super, the keyboard is wonderful, and I'm personally fine with not having a user replaceable battery.

Boutilier ""Jim Boutilier""","[4,4]","After being used to traveling with a MacBook Pro I wondered if the MacBook Air would have enough performance and capacity to satisfy my needs.This is a beautiful machine.  Extremely thin but very sturdy feeling.  Wonderfully light even with required accessories.  A terrific screen and keyboard that are a pleasure during all day use.  Good battery life (about 4 hours in my case).  Good processor and graphics power for mainstream business applications.  Adequate disk space but limited disk performance.  Barest minumum of ports requires dongles and a usb hub.While its slower than my Macbook pro, the only times I really notice a difference are:- Booting the machine takes longer (but I usually only do that a couple times a week)- Starting some applications takes longer (but once started I can still run a LOT of apps in 2gb even including Parallels)- True multitasking is limited to one intensive disk or cpu operation at a time (don't try and use the machine for anything significant while doing a backup, or while ripping a DVD).So under normal use I was very pleasantly surprised how useable the AIR felt after being used to a PRO.  For me the size and weight reduction is definitely worth the performance reduction.Yes I would like a bigger, faster hard drive, but next year 120gb 5400rpm single platter units should be available.  Yes I would like a built in ethernet port, but I'm not willing to pay a big form factor price to avoid the $29 dongle.  Yes I would like 2-3 USB ports, but Targus makes some really tiny 4 port hubs for now.I'm honestly not sure I would make any different design choices, and technology progress will take care of the only thing I've found to be occasionally very limiting (disk size and performance).",4,Excellent machine with interesting compromises,08/09/2008

My Dell only lasted about 2.5 hours - so I know where all the outlets are in airports / airplanes / lounges when I am on the road.  It is nice to only have to charge half as much!!I am using my MBA in conjunction with a wireless network at my house.  The remote disk feature worked seamlessly when I installed software from the SuperDrive on my Mac Mini via WiFi to my MBA.  In addition, I installed the remote disk software on my Dell, just to see if I could watch a movie - and I could! (Remote disk allows a user to watch movies the user has created, and install software remotely - however, it doesn't allow a user to watch a commercial DVD remotely)I thought the MBA would be fairly slow with larger programs such as PhotoShop - surprisingly enough it works just fine!I am keeping all of the bookmarks, preferences, address books, mail accounts, etc synced between my Mac Mini, MBA, and iPod Touch using my .Mac account.Any files I want to use between the devices, I use via 'Sharing Files' under preferences in Leopard.If you haven't used Leopard before - you are in for a treat!I have Expose set up so every time I move my mouse to the upper left corner of my screen 'All Windows' come to the forefront.  I also have it set so if I move my mouse to the lower left portion of my screen, it launches Spaces.Spaces is a program that works as if you have 'virtual desktops'.  I set mine up to have 12 'screens' - two rows, six columns.  This means I can be running up to twelve programs - or have up to 12 windows open at a time - move my cursor to the lower left of the screen, enter Spaces and switch between any of the twelve applications / screens - with literally one movement and a click.Speaking of clicks - I don't use the track pad buttons like I used to - which was odd at first - but, once I got used to using the functions of the new track pad - one finger (tap=left click), two fingers (tap=right click), or three fingers (swipe=next page/screen), two finger pinch= small font/small pic, two finger spread=larger font/larger pic - I can't imagine ever going back.Overall, I am VERY pleased with the performance of this device.  I used to 'make a decision' whether or not to 'lug' along my laptop, now I just grab the MBA.I recommend purchasing the Ethernet/USB adapter - we all have to use Ethernet at some point ;-)BTW - if you are looking for a carrying case - I purchased a bag from SFBags.com which is basically a sleeve, a flap, and a shoulder strap for under a hundred bucks - and it's VERY high quality.  You will want to get a size 13-2 (MBA) and a suspension strap (it has a gripper pad on it).",5,Worth every penny - and the wait,02/26/2008

Meyer ""acuitize""","[19,26]","I purchased a 1.6Ghz 80GB HDD based MacBook Air about 2 weeks ago.  Honestly I was not sure that I would keep the device but I had to review it for myself based on some not so positive reviews and the fact that I own a large amount of Apple stock and have been concerned about the recent drop in the stock price.My business is to help companies make better products with better overall strategic plans and I have learned from past experience that many ""professional"" reviewers really don't get it.  Often they write great reviews for terrible products and while not as often they also write terrible reviews for great products.  In a past life I directly managed the widely successful Iomega Zip drive so I speak from a level of experience on this issue.  In short it was easily worth a 10% restocking fee to me to find out what I thought the real truth is.In my acuitize consulting business we have found that after extensive direct in person customer interviews working with a wide variety of companies with an even wider variety of products that customers really care about only a few key items for each of the products or services they buy.  We call these items the ""defining parameters"" of any true 10X product or service.  While there are lots of items that must be accomplished well for a true 10X product we find that there are only 3-5 things that must be done to perfection to achieve 10x success.So what do I now believe?The quickest answer is that within an hour of my first use there was no way that I was taking the system back.  Words cannot do justice to the sheer brilliance of the industrial design of this product.  It simply ""feels"" great when you use it and it is so thin and light you become worried that you forgot it on a business trip.  The screen is simply brilliant and far better that any screen I have ever seen on any other laptop I have used or seen to date.  The keyboard, while I am probably the world's worst typist, also ""feels"" great when you use it.  I have found myself using the system all over my house at all times of day due to the wonderful backlight keyboard & display (& size).  I'd rather go without paying my heat bill than taking back the air!The Good- The industrial design and size/weight.- The screen- The keyboard- The overall feeling of a supremely engineered product-  It's a Mac and it comes with Leopard and iLife 08- The tradeoffs they made to fit the size/weight requirements are fine with me and largely non-issues (& my issues can be fixed)-  If you buy it you will love it (ps - I am not connected with Apple in any way)Interestingly while I have a number of issues with the product I think they could all be easily fixed into the future making the ""Air"" a true 10x product.  By the way I think you will find my ""issues"" are largely different from what most reviewers write as the issues.My issues;#1 - The price is simply way too high for wild market acceptanceWhile I would love to do the research to determine the real price points required can you imagine the sales of this product if it were a $499 product ramping up to a $999 product as opposed to the $2K-$3K product it is today?  High volumes will lower manufacturing costs that should allow Apple to do this in the future (an inherently this system should be cheaper to build anyway).  By the way for me the dramatically increased price and lower storage capacity make the solid-state storage option a non-factor for me (I continue to be amazed at what appears to be close to a 50/50 sales mix of the solid-state option to the HDD based option).  Give me a 128GB solid sate drive at a $500 or lower cost and then I will be interested.  Up until then, and speaking as a shareholder rather than a user, I love the mix of sales of the higher end system.#2 - Migration and Syncing is a disasterThis one amazes me and one I think is a huge disappointment especially from a company like Apple that seems to think this stuff out ahead of time.  It is based on the premise that the vast majority of MacBook air buyers (especially at the current prices) already will own another ""main"" Mac.  Migration assistant needs to be greatly modified to enable simply and easily dealing with moving only your critical stuff to the air to fit in the limited space available (now it's an all or nothing approach).  Migrating your stuff from another Mac is an enormous pain and waste of time.  Interestingly I think they completely solved a parallel issue to this in the removal of the optical disk drive by enabling remote drive access.  I did buy a $99 superdrive but after 2 weeks it's still in the plastic wrapped box and I doubt I will ever use it.On a similar issue an what presents a much larger ongoing problem is synching between the air and your ""main"" Mac.  It is simply a pain to try and keep my Air and iMac synched with the same critical stuff.  From the examples that Apple already set with the iPod and AppleTV with ""great"" synching capabilities it amazes me they dropped the ball on this feature for the Air.  Apple representatives have told me to use .Mac but I find this an unacceptable answer.  My #1 software priority would be a great wireless simple software synching functionality as per AppleTV and the iPod.Interesting what was my largest pre-purchase factor was the smallish 80GB hard drive (I really wished it was 120 or 160GB at least).  Now I have found that after a painful couple of days of moving my critical stuff that 80GB is in fact fine for me - just make it easy for me to move my stuff on and off of it.#3 - I hate the dongle for video presentations (I am afraid I will lose it or leave it behind)I assume that a lot of traveling professionals are like me and need from time to time to connect the air to an external projector.  While to Apple's credit they do provide the cable as standard I hat the dongle idea.  I think this could be solved by simply shipping the air with a neat internal and inexpensive protective case-in-a-case that can go in your laptop bag that has a standard place for the power adapter and dongles.  On a similar not the low cost remote should have also been included primarily for remote presentations if not for watching movies (at $2K or $3K leaving a $2 cost remote out was a extremely poor strategic decision.).My bottom line is that, even with these shortcomings, if you can afford it buy the ""Air"" you will love it!",5,"Macbook Air, despite issues, if you buy it you will love it!",03/01/2008

I mostly use windows for browsing/entertainment related stuff and dual boot it with ubuntu or red hat for development work. I never used mac.My search for an ultra portable started when my commute suddenly went from a 1 hour daily commute to 4:15 hour daily commute.My criteria were: min 13 inch laptop, comfortable keyboard, a screen that is comfortable to work on in daylight, easy to carry around(prolly &lt; 3 or 3.5 lbs).Finally I settled on mac book air. I did read some reviews where I heard macbook was getting too hot so I resisted buying mac. But with the latest release of macbook air, I heard from other reviewers that it has been fixed with this version of the mac book air.So I took the jump from pc to mac. And boy, am I glad that i did.first and foremost feature of macbook air that won my heart is the keyboard. island style, pretty comfortable and very convenient to keep on typing long articles. In fact, this review is being written on my new mac book air.other feature worth noting is the weight. For &lt; 3 lbs and being so thin, it feels even lighter than 3 lbs. So full marks when it comes to weight.screen is also pretty comfortable to do development work.one gripe was that mac os x didnt feel natural. This might be because I never worked on mac os x. But I guess once I get used to the OS, it wont be too much an issue.screen size with the resolution of 1440x98o (approx) feels good enough to do any development work.so overall, the latest version of macbook air 13.3 inch is a good chioce when it comes to ultra portables. you wont go wrong with this mac.I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for an ultra portable.This might not be that great for someone looking for a laptop to watch movies etc.. at home.

This is as close to the perfect travel computer that I've ever used!Now the not-so-greats:- there really should have been more than one usb port. It can be handled if you need more through a small usb hub, but that's not ideal. One more port should have been included.- Wired ethernet. Would have been nice to have that built in too, but the dongle works well and is really almost never needed for me at least. I bring a small wireless router with me anyway so I never really need to use wired ethernet. Still, it's a convenience.- built in battery that require unscrewing many screws to replace. This is a design decision and I'm not sure I agree with it. If the battery holds up reasonably well for a year or so and it's easy to get replacement batteries, I think it's not a bad decision, but if these batteries are not good quality and don';t last it'll piss me off. I'd like the option  to bring an extra battery, but I've never done it before so even if I had the option I probably wouldn't use it. If you need to work for many hours on the plane, this is not good. On the other hand, it's just a matter of time before all airlines start having plugs for laptops in all cabins. Mixed feelings about this decision, but I love the design so much (and it would be different with a removable battery) that it feels like it outweighs this issue....not rational, but that's the way I feel.That's it. This is the nicest laptop I've used, despite it's minor inconveniences.

I am a bright screen junkie and this screen is so much brighter than my old MacBook.I have been a computer user for 13 years and a Mac User for about 8 or 9 and there is just something about buying a Mac that makes me giddy in a way buying a PC never did.  Apple products truly are elegant and beautiful and make work seem less so . . .I'm glad to see that the reviews here on amazon seem to be from actual AirBook owners as opposed to those reviews I've found elsewhere that are heavily weighed down by people who don't even own it.The biggest complaints seem to be price and lack of optical drive.In regards to price I don't really see the issue highly portable laptops are ALWAYS priced at a premium and the similar offering on the PC side (The Sony Vaio VZ that appears to have ripped off the MacBook's keyboard design) starts @ $2,199 for a 1.2GHz processor with a Hard Drive that is only 20GB bigger.  Do I wish the AirBook was cheaper?  Sure, but I'm one of those people who will pay to shave 2 lbs. off my travel weight.In regards to the lack of optical drive - WAHOO!  For me it was a reason to buy this AirBook.  I rarely use an optical drive these days.I don't burn CD's anymore I use an iPod.I don't watch DVDs anymore, I rip them in Handbrake and watch them from the hard drive.  So I can rip the movie on my iMac and transfer it via a memory card or a USB Drive.  Easy-Peasy.99% of the software I use can be downloaded from the net so no installation CD needed.  The one program I did need was MS Office 2008 and the installation using my iMac's drive was flawless and straightforward.As many around the 'net have stated I can't imagine this being anyone's primary computer but as a travel companion and for web-surfing, e-mail and documents Mac fans need not hesitate.I haven't used any processor intensive programs such as Photoshop or VMWare but I don't have to: that's why I have my iMac.  I'm currently using my AB with a few Firefox windows open with several tabs, MS Excel, MS Entourage and Filemaker and all is running quite smooth.Do I wish Mac's Ultra-portable had a 11.1 or 12.1"" screen instead of 13.3"" making it even lighter with a smaller footprint?  YES but I'm reviewing what IS not what I wish would be.I actually find myself looking forward to my first business trip with this puppy because I know that will make me love this bad boy even more.UPDATE: Since the MBA doesn't seem as slow as I feared it might be I installed Photoshop C3 and it works like a charm.  Tried to install VMWare but no dice - you need the external drive for that as VMWare doesn't recognize Remote Disc.  Another observation not only does the MBA run very quiet it runs VERY COOL - I can't remember the last time a laptop didn't burn the cr*p out of my lap!",5,"Wow, Just WOW!",02/24/2008

I have no fear that it will break in my briefcase.I have been pondering for years to buy a 10"" vaio from Sony. This is many times better with the large screen, full size keyboard, and of course Mac OS operating system means I don't have to have an anti-virus software that slows my computer down to a crawl and screws up my computer every time it is upgraded. Its cheaper than the vaio I was going to buy also.This is  perfect for me.

Fan starts running at 6200 RPM (max speed) and then everything slows drown drastically and you are forced to shutdown.I took my machine to the apple repair center and after keeping the machine for 1 week they said that there is nothing wrong with it and it is performing as per designed capabilities!!!!I came back and checked the internet and this seems to be ever present problem with all the 1st generation macbook Air. Apple is -- after 8 months of launching the 1st generation -- making major revamps in hardware by adding an external graphic card to improve performance.Knowing this, I feel cheated as apple sold me an 'Experimental' product and fooled to pay such a price for a junk I cant put to a meaningful use.And I plan to refrain from apple products (although my old macbook did not give any major problems).",1,'Experimental' Junk!!!,12/02/2008

Even after many months of use, it still has the ""wow"" factor when people see it, something us Apple geeks truly thrive on...and it has all the features i need on the road.I did break down and buy the external superdrive, because it is just so much faster than using the Remote Disk feature on the MBA. In addition, I found that I use the ethernet USB adapter more ofter than not, since it is suprising how many hotels in the US and Europe are NOT wireless -- order one with your MBA and spare the hassle. I think Cupertino must run on a different system, since wireless is an amazing idea that might work there, but does not work in 90 percent of the rest of america.Still, the speed it good, I don't notice any major slowness, programs open zippily, run well, and everything just plain old works.I read a lot of reviews before buying, and I have to tell you, I have experienced zero of the problems that some write about.

The thing it was missing was unbelievable!  How could you possibly function without a floppy drive!  This computer will never make it.  Fast forward 9 years.  The MBA comes out with no optical drive.  Sure, not the first laptop, but neither was the iMac without a floppy.  Now we see, no laptop or desktop comes with a floppy of any kind.  I do believe the MBA will do the same with the optical drive.  It is really the one thing limiting designs of computers.  Sure, you can be thin, but have to be at least six inches wide, to hold an optical drive.  Flash should fix this problem.  I can fit twice as much on a thumb drive as a DL DVD at a tenth the space. so on to the MBA.  Any software or movie I want, I download over the internet.  I have rarely needed the optical drive with this computer.(+)  I went from a Blackbook to this.  All I do on my computer is surf the internet, check email, listen to music, watch movies/TV shows.  This does it all.  This thing is holding 15 gigs of music, 10 gigs of pictures, Spore, and I have 29.29 gigs free.  Did I mention Spore?  This thing runs Spore quite well.  Someone said this thing is underpowered, have they actually tried doing anything on it, or are they just looking at the specs?  Weight.  This thing is light, but unlike an x300 or Sony TT/TZ, looks good doing it.  Backlight.  Beautiful screen, very clear and bright.  Keyboard.  Didn't think they could improve from the iBook keyboard, but they did with the Macbook, put it in the air and added backlighting.  Perfect.  Case.  Sturdy, easy to clean, doesn't pick up fingerprints, though like the MBP, hurts Wifi.  I can hook it up to my 1080p LCD, this thing will output 1920x1080 while watching Hulu, couldn't ask for more.(-) No optical drive, one usb port, no ethernet, no firewire, non-replaceable battery, small HDD, poor graphics.  If you put these under negative, than you are missing the point.  Apple makes it pretty clear before you drop your hard-earned cheddar that it has none of these things.  It is like saying you bought a new convertible, but you are disappointed it won't haul your dining room table.  You know it is 4"" off the ground and 2WD but still make a point that it can't go off-road.  No sht.  On to the real negatives.  I cannot install boot camp without a Superdrive.  I tried using an LG usb powered DVD burner that I bought with my EEE.  Work great for everything on the air except Boot camp.  Probably no firmware in the BIOS to run it.  Hinge.  Seems delicate, I have seen many a cracked in half MBA because people think this thing can lay flat.  Ambient sensor.  Too sensitive.  In low light conditions, it constantly adjusts the brightness of the screen and keyboard.  I realize I can turn it off, but it does work well in light and dark situations.Other than that, excellent machine.

Purchasing this older model after waiting for the new one shaved a couple of hundred bucks off the price. It's not the machine for everyone, but it was for me for these reasons:- weight matters. The (obvious) primary and only reason to buy this machine.  The latest MacBook weighs just 1 1/2 lbs more, but it still makes a difference on my old back and in the volume it takes up in my bags. This is a laptop I finally use on my lap (heat generated notwithstanding)- have another Mac. That serves for the optical drive for installs and backups. If necessary, I always have the option of buying the external superdrive.- don't really use optical drives much to begin with. The only thing I miss is not being able to watch a DVD on the laptop, but not often enough.- no heavy duty computing needed - it's an alternate machine, not the primary. Mostly Internet and writing, although I could run Photoshop, etc... if I wanted to (if I can on an old MacMini, I can here). VMware runs fine, and have no heavy disk storage requirements.- can get by with the limited port configuration (1 USB port, no Firewire, no Ethernet).If weight doesn't matter to you, and the other factors are too limiting, then you'd be much better off with the Macbook or the MacBook Pro which meet all your needs and can serve as  your primary computer at a better price/value ratio.

After owning it for a few months I noticed that I would get home and my back would be in agony from carrying so much weight around dally.  I decided that was enough was enough, and I went down and I purchased my Macbook Air the day it came out.The Macbook Air is extremely light, thin and pretty sturdy.  My back-pain at the end of the day is gone and in fact I constantly forget I have it on my back... one of the only problems I have had with its size is finding a backpack that doesn't weight more than the air itself (I ended up going with the Buzz by Tom Bihn).I have edited THOUSANDS of photos in photoshop, put together movies with iMovie and Final Cut Express, written short stories , watched movies with EyeTV and have done pretty much anything I did on my Macbook Pro.  That being said, it is a less powerful machine so I will sometimes see freezes, most which occur in Safari (which I no longer use).I have dropped it, thrown it on my couch, and carried it to 3 countries and 7 states. I seriously cannot understand people who are breaking these.. as I havent treated my exactly well, but I do understand it is a portable computer which are all delicate pieces of machinery.People invariably ask me questions about it when they see my in public, one is ""Dont you miss your DVD drive?"" And my answer is always no.  I have the USB drive to install programs requiring a DVD, which I have needed maybe 5 times total. People wonder how I can watch movies, and you know.. I no longer own any DVDs... I ONLY watch digital movies now.. whats the point of wasting space in my house with DVDs I may watch once or twice.  The other question people ask is about the air only having one USB port. Yes, this has been a bit annoying a few times (Especially since the Air has a disabled USB port turned off inside of it), but I have gotten around this by carrying a tiny USB splitter, and have needed to use that maybe 3 times total.I have to admit however that I also have a full MacPro, which I keep all of my files on and that the Macbook Air is my portable office.  I move everything that I have on it over the desktop when I am home, and am not sure I would be able to survive with only an 80 GB drive, but as I have 2 terabytes of data, I am sure you would understand why.If you are interested in buying this machine I would suggest staying away from solid state drives for now, as they are more expensive for the size and the failure rate appears to be higher than normal hard drives.  However, I LOVE my Air.If you are on the fence, I would suggest getting it! But as with any Apple, I would also get an extra year of Apple Care.

As a student i don't really need this computer for much more than word documents, internet, email, itunes, and the occasional movie/youtube video. Speed has not been an issue - something i wasn't sure about as i almost purchased the SSD option.  Fortunately i didn't and this has been fine.  I ordered the superdrive just in case though i havn't used it yet.  For installing microsoft office i used the remote disc drive and that worked absolutely fine.  So far the fan/overheating problem that other people were talking about hasn't been an issue and the temp does get warm, but not hot enough to get laggy or be uncomfortable.  So far my two nitpicks are that the battery isn't great - 4+ hours of internet/itunes if the screen brightness is down all the way... but i like to keep the brightness at at least 50%.  The other thing is that the screen hinge design doesn't allow the screen to go very far back.  As far as the port limitations go the only thing i use is audio jack, usb, and ethernet at school but there's wifi too.  I did order the ethernet dongle just in case.

The screen is great.  very thin and truly ultraportable, though not quite as light as you might think.  overall, a truly beautiful laptop.  i also think the price is excellent--a very fair price for such a nice ultraportable computer.  most any serious computer user can afford this beauty.  the power chord is great.the bad: no optical drive, means no dvds, not cd installs, unless using another computer, by which it can use file sharing to transfer the data over wireless, which is FAR from ideal.  this is a big downer, as everyone will want to watch a dvd sometime, expecially on the plane or on a trip...  you should definitely buy a usb thumb drive or two, a usb hub, a usb ethernet device, and a nice case to go along with the purchase. u can buy an external cd/dvd player/burner, but lugging that along kills the form factor and portability of the unit.  battery life is about 3-4 hours, for me, per charge, which is OK, not great considering i'm just surfing and using imail 3/4 of the time. throwing in a neoprene case or something should have been included for an 1800 dollar laptop.  i have no problem buying one seperately, but throwing in a 5-10 dollar case would have been considerate, and other high-end laptop mfgrs throw this in.the ugly:  video capabilities are weak, just sufficient enough to get by.  i can't edit movies with imovie nearly as well as i can with my macbook pro (1.8 ghz). and i'm afraid as more programs become more graphics intensive, this may be a big problem after a few years. harddrive speed is noticably inferior--the read access time and write performance are palpably slower than my other notebooks.  harddrive space is limited as well, and considering there's no dvd/cd player, it magnifies the problem.I could easily give this 4 stars, but will give it a 3 because it simply can't serve all my needs, no way.  it's terrific as a primary laptop used for email and other light tasks, but if you're a serious computer user, it alone is nowhere near enough.  it's probably worthy of 4 stars for it's overwhelming pro's,  and 5 stars as a secondary/special use laptop, but the con's i mentioned earlier are legitimate and wonder how it's going to to fare with the next generation OS and programs, considering it's pathetic integrated video card.  whereas, i know my macbook pro will be ready for whatever i throw at it for 5 more years.on a side note, i also own a Dell M1330, and it's just 1.5 lbs heavier, but gives me alot more (cpu, hd, ram, and video!) power for almost half the price.  also a sleek, pretty machine, but definitely not on my MBA's level aestheticly, and is not quite ""ultraportable.""  still, if you're a pc user, i'd recc'd it.  i have goen through a dozen notebooks over the past 6 years, handing them down to friends and family, and i now down to three (macbook pro, air, m1330, plus a desktop imac, and 1 desktop pc).  don't get me wrong though, i currently adore my macbook air, it serves it's purpose very well.  that said, my dell m1330 and my macbook pro are more indispensable and ""important"" to me.",3,"love it now, but afraid i won't as much after the newness wears off",03/11/2008

In fact, there's only one.* The battery is not replaceable.* There is no integrated Wi-Max.* The battery life is on par with current generation Apple laptops.* It's ""underpowered"" in this generation of overpowered desktop-replacements.Consumers who worry about the above, but still want to run a variation of OS X may purchase this:Apple MacBook MB063LL/B 13.3"" Laptop (2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, 8x Super Drive) BlackOr this:Apple MacBook Pro MA896LL/A 15"" Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD SuperDrive).Or simply get the Thinkpad X300 and run it on a last generation OS.But I gave this 5 stars, why?* It's beautiful.* The build is solid.* I can carry it in one hand with no effort.And here's the thing about the lack of ports.* Peripherals will eventually all be wireless.Bluetooth peripherals are already in the marketplace (obviously where Apple hedges its bets on).

But consider this in two years:* SSD will be the standard for all future laptops.This price will definitely go down in future renditions of the laptop and will no doubt be the standard in 2 - 3 years.  Not only will the price fall, but the speed and quality will undoubtedly increase too.I've had every laptop hard drive fail on me throughout the past 5 years.  No more.  The reason why the military invests in SSD is in their stability.  I ""needed"" stability in my laptop HDs, and I ""wanted"" it now.This laptop is ahead of its time.  People shouldn't kid themselves.  It's the equivalent of having the option to own either a Ferrari or a Toyota pickup (Apple apparently recommends both i.e. wireless CD access).  They accomplish the same thing, but the former's capacity is limited by legal speed limits.  Not only that, the former is vastly expensive to maintain and has limited applicability.Both is better, but if you had to choose?This laptop is the same thing.

A20WS8TZ5840ND,B0006HU4NK,Apple,"Apple MacBook Air 13.3-inch Laptop (1.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive)","Adam Dachis ""adachis""","[82,92]","This is a very in-depth review, so if you want to get to the point I suggest skipping to the last paragraph.I might not have much to say that hasn't already been said several times over, but I wanted to give my take on this laptop as it's can be a difficult choice to make and perhaps I can be of some help.  When the Air was released I thought it was the height of frivolity for Apple, but I've since come to understand it better.  I spent eight days getting to know it in the standard 1.8Ghz/64GB SSD configuration and I'm still wavering on whether or not I want to keep it.  I'm writing this review on a MacBook Pro that has been configured to be almost the exact opposite of what you'd get with the Air.  When I bought the Air I wanted to see if I could handle such immense limitations, being so used to the freedom of maxed out laptops and desktops.  As I'm writing this, the answer is ""kind of.""The MacBook Air, in my opinion, is ridiculously expensive.  It's also ridiculously cool, especially when it's closed.  In fact, every time I found something I didn't like and soon closed it to let it sleep, I had difficulty hating the thing because it's just so cool when it collapses to be a thin sheet of metal.  Every little nuance of the outer design is elegant and perfect--visually, that is.  There are a some hardware flaws that may or may not upset the user, and one that, in my opinion, throws the machine's worth into question.  Let's deal with that first.As someone who thought he used several USB devices, I found that I really do not.  I might use two at a time, namely when importing footage from a video camera into the computer and saving it to an external hard drive.  An important thing to note is that while the Air is certainly not made for video editing, it manages nonetheless.  It can be done and it's not as horrible as one would imagine.  Having one USB port also works just fine in pretty much every other case.  I did get a tiny hub to use with the Air, but as it's tiny it's not a nuisance to carry and generally doesn't get carried around anyhow.  If I'm editing, I'll usually edit at a home (not mine, as I'd use a desktop machine at home).  Although it can get by, I would never recommend the air as a video editing machine.  This probably goes without saying.  Still, it's good to know that it can if it has to (even with Final Cut Studio's lack of support for it's integrated graphics processor).Many people conclude that the Air is impractical as the machine does not have an optical drive.  If you live by CDs and/or DVDs, then yes, it probably isn't practical for you.  I never use my optical drive in my MacBook Pro.  If I want to watch a movie, I rip it first.  Most people do the same with their music so I don't think it's fair to cite this as a reason you'd need an optical drive.  This does assume, of course, that you have another machine with an optical drive.  If you don't and you want the Air as a primary machine then you will absolutely need to purchase the optional Super Drive Apple offers.  You might think of going with a cheaper drive, such as the ones Lacie makes (which are good), but I wouldn't as even the Air, with it's added USB power, cannot power them.  The one Apple offers doesn't cost much more and is worth it if you have no other machine.  But if you do and you don't want to travel around with a drive (like me), there's another nice solution that I found worked very well.  I bought a few 8GB flash drives, which are comparable to the speed of a DVD (if not faster) and hardly cost anything these days.  I loaded the MacBook Air's installation media on one drive and made it bootable so I could restore the operating system or boot from the media while traveling should the need arise.  I used one drive to hold a few movies I wanted to watch and another for any vital software I would need to install should I need to ever wipe the Air's drive while traveling.  I bought four 8GB drives but only used three to do all of this.  For less than the size of three fingers you can easily prepare for the worst and bring along some entertainment.  If you want to bring along several more movies and music, an iPod is a good choice.  You can always hook it up to the Air and play the movies/music through the machine.I wanted to save it for last, but it makes sense to address the biggest flaw of the machine now.  As I've said, this is not a video machine.  It can be a video machine under very specific circumstances, but it is not, apparently, designed for use with any video at all whatsoever.  I say this because of how the Air handles heat.  The graphics processor (GPU) warms up rather quickly, even if you're just browsing the web.  Watching video on the Internet, or even on your hard drive (perhaps something you downloaded from iTunes, generates quite a bit of heat.  When the machine grows too hot, the first thing it does is underclock the GPU.  Imagine watching a movie at about 1 or 2 frames per second.  This is what you can expect when the Air gets too hot.  If this wasn't the case, I wouldn't be so conflicted over the machine.  I can let go of doing any heavy media work with it, but I can't let go of being able to watch a TV show without it skipping.  You can work around this terrible design flaw by giving the air vent plenty of room to breathe.  What I did is put the sleeve I purchased under the Air and then rested most of the air on it.  I let the back section, with the air vent, hang off the edge so it had space to vent.  This worked perfectly when the Air wasn't hooked up to external power.  When it was, it became a problem.  It was an issue on an airplane, though, and the short power available on the flight may have been feeding more power into the Air than it should have.  The Air exhibited some strange behavior when plugged into the power port on the airplane, rendering the trackpad pretty much useless.  The Air seemed to hold up just fine, when it had breathing room, when plugged into a normal outlet.  Nonetheless, this trick is annoying and is even required when the Air is on a desk or table (though you'd get through a sitcom without any trouble if it's on a desk).  The computer should be able to play back an MPEG4 or H.264 file without skipping, throughout the duration, without special treatment.  If you have no interest in doing anything with video, watching or otherwise, this won't be a problem for you.  I just can't imagine anyone using their laptop these days without watching some sort of video online or on their machine.  I see this as an enormous drawback and will be the main reason I return the machine, if I decide to do so (and it is what I'm leaning towards).But moving on...Perhaps disk space is a drawback?  I thought it would be for me, but I found that I only used about 25GB once I loaded on everything I felt I needed, including my entire music collection (which is only about 9GB and not the norm, I'll admit) and photo library.  I also loaded about 3GB of e-mail, Final Cut Pro, Final Draft, Adobe CS3 (without Illustrator and InDesign), Episode, VisualHub, and several other pieces of software.  I installed almost every piece of software I have on my MacBook Pro and left off the things I've either never used or used so rarely I forgot I had them.  I didn't miss a single thing.  I certainly use the majority of my MacBook Pro's 250GB disk and have so much data on external drives, at home, that it would scare you (I never throw anything away), but in terms of what you actually use I'd bet you'll find you can fit it on a 64GB or 80GB drive very easily.  You did a few years ago, right?  Perhaps you're still doing it.  Either way, there's an easy solution.  Buy an external hard drive.  Some might argue that this is sort of counter-intuitive as the point of the air is to be pretty much non-existent.  Adding things goes against that mantra.  Well, yes, but again you can leave this drive at home or where you're staying.  When you're walking around with the Air you don't need it.  When you go back to your hotel, your friend's house, or wherever you're staying, you can pull it out of your other bag (the one you used for clothing, etc.).  If you're at home, well, then you certainly have somewhere to put it.  Rarely will you have to take it with you and it's not like it's that big if you do.  I have a couple of Western Digital 250GB Passport drives (in black, if you're wondering) and they're great.  I don't see drive space as a drawback at all.  It's a problem easily solved.There may be questions for some if the SSD is faster than a standard hard drive.  For random tasks, yes, very much.  OS X is good with caching common tasks, such as launching applications you use often, so while application performance is definitely faster via SSD the crappy little 1.8"" iPod hard drive the standard model has will not slow you down too much once the Air gets to know your habits.  Startup isn't as instant as everyone says, but you can immediately use the machine after startup.  I'd much rather have an SSD over a hard drive as the speed increase is very noticeable, but my main draw to the SSD version of the Air was for data security.  It's just less likely to die and that is very appealing to me.Speaking of death, battery life is what you'd expect from an Apple Laptop.  In fact, I might call it both better and worse.  During my tests, I went to a coffee shop to write for a few hours.  I left with about 30 minutes left on the battery, having used it for two and a half hours (give or take ten minutes).  I wasn't playing music, browsing the web, or anything at all.  I had the wireless off.  The only issue is that I was in direct sunlight and countered it with the display at full brightness (which is completely and wonderfully visible).  For a battery rated for five hours under wireless use with the screen not much dimmer than full brightness I was a little disappointed that it only made it what I assume would have been three hours without wireless.  Nonetheless, I rarely use my laptop without plugging it in so it's good enough for me.  Still, I fully intend to use the battery more once they figure out how to make it last a full day.  Imagine that...The power cord is so small you can easily take it with you.  Actually, it's really not that small if you think back a few years when we used to have G4s.  It's terribly small compared to the existing adapters and the way the mag safe attaches is so much nicer than it is on any of Apple's other laptops.  It doesn't fall out by accident, still comes off easily, and doesn't get pushed out of the way by your knee/leg when the machine is on your lap.  I hope this is how all Apple laptops are powered in the future.I have nothing to say about the micro DVI port because I haven't used it.  I suppose I could, but I assume it works fine.  There's not much to screw up.  One thing to note about the ports, though, is that despite the beautiful little hatch they're housed in they are a bit difficult to use.  It requires slightly more concentration than the average port when plugging something in.  It's not a big deal, but it might be a bother at times.The built-in speaker is awful, but everyone knows that by now.  It's a single channel speaker.  If you're the type who watches movies with friends on a 13"" laptop this might be a problem.  I don't know any people like that who don't do so at home and plug in a pair of speakers they have lying around.  If you're by yourself, you have headphones.  I wish the speakers were better but I don't see this as a drawback.The keyboard is a pleasure to type on and the backlight is far more effective on the Air than it is on the Pro.  The keyboard also seems to be better-crafted than both the standard MacBook and the the wired/wireless keyboards (I'm typing on a wireless now).  I don't know how that could be, but it is.  Maybe it's just because it's new and I'm now used to typing on the ""chiclet"" keys.While a little heavier than you'd expect, the Air is fairly light.  I think the main thing to look at, when considering weight, is if you can safely hold it when gripping with one hand (without fear for your wrist or the laptop's safety, or both).  The Air has no problem in a single-handed tweezer grip and your wrist will be fine as well.  It is as minimal as they say it is and will pretty much fit into any bag you've got.  I thought I was going to need a new bag but found that it fit into an old one I usually carried when deciding NOT to bring a computer.  That was a very pleasant surprise.Still, despite the fun of it and all the nice little benefits it has I cannot get over the situation with the heat and the GPU.  It really ruins the machine for me.  I think that, regardless of whether or not this will be a second computer you can make the determination of whether or not to buy fairly easily.  If you were once a boy scout (meaning you always like to be prepared) and/or you've recently told yourself that you need to clean, get rid of stuff, or simplify your life, you will have trouble with this machine.  There will be things you won't like, perhaps to the end that you won't keep the machine.  But if your life, in terms of technology and other things (literal), is already simple and you don't dwell on preparedness too often, you'll probably enjoy this machine very much.  If all I did was write, or all I did was write code, or all I did was write school papers and surf the web this would be an overpriced but very capable machine.  I kind of saw it as the writer's dream machine, which is why I got it (I'm moving into that field primarily, now), but I have too many interests for the Air to handle.  I might just keep it because I'm currently overpaid and I wouldn't mind it as a backup/travel machine, but I'm mostly feeling it was the wrong purchase and I'd be better suited by a cheaper, standard MacBook for a backup laptop (especially since I can mirror the data and I love the black MacBook).  While I absolutely hated it when it came out, I've since found that it really is a machine well-suited for certain kinds of people.  If you've got the money and intend to be gentle, it's probably a good choice for you.  If your laptop is a third arm, I'd suggest holding your breath for a year or two.UPDATE:I have good news.  I decided to keep it and turns out that I had a bad machine (""had"" being the good news).  I took it in because the trackpad clicker button didn't work very well and they gave me a brand new machine (very, very nice of them).  Not only did that resolve the problem I took it in for, but I no longer get horrible choppy graphics when using the computer on my lap/in bed/when the vents are partially blocked.  While I've heard gaming won't survive under those conditions, this is a MAJOR improvement for me.  If I could, I would change my rating to four stars.  The Air pretty much does everything I'd want it to at this point and the solid-state disk makes the majority of things I do much faster than the standard 5400RPM hard drive I have in my MacBook Pro.  I judged the machine too harshly in the review because I thought I had a model that worked properly :).  I am very pleased with it now that it can do what it should be able to do.  I'm looking forward to finding out if it can even handle some light video editing.Also, I got a Transcend 32GB flash drive as a supplement.  So far I haven't used it for anything than taking a bunch of movies and TV shows along with me, but it's a nice alternative to a traditional hard drive if you don't want the bulk but are concerned about the spacial limitations of an SSD.",3,Both wonderful and terrible and highly dependent on your requirements.,04/03/2008

Mine is the SSD version and it is my work computer, used for Web development, occasional graphics work in Creative Suite, and bookkeeping using QuickBooks for Windows via Parallels.After reading all the debate about the relative performance compared to more powerful machines as well as complaints about lack of ports and other ""features"", I have found that the actual daily ease-of-use is incredible. It is quiet and very portable, the screen is fantastic, the trackpad is highly responsive, waking from sleep is instantaneous, and the speed for regular work using a variety of applications is very fast.My existing peripherals work with the Air. The only accessories I purchased are the USB Ethernet adapter and a neoprene sleeve. I do not own a SuperDrive, Airport Extreme router, or Time Capsule backup. I was able to reinstall OS X Leopard without many of the extras and saved a significant amount of disk space. With all my applications and files, there is still 29 GB of available space on the 64 GB drive.Customizing the set up was surprisingly easy. Using a typical non-Apple wireless router and the USB Ethernet adapter, I plugged in to the wired ports and used Remote Disc to reinstall Leopard and several third-party applications. After the initial set up, Remote Disc then works over any wireless network. For backing up, I use a 2.5-inch, SATA hard drive in a USB enclosure. The USB port on the Air delivers enough power out of the single connection (no two-wired connections necessary).Compared to my former machine, a MacBook Pro with 4GB of memory, the two caveats are that I cannot have a ton of application open at once, and intensive Photoshop work takes a performance hit. But these two negatives are far outweighed by the positives.Since prices are coming down for SSDs in general, the price is coming down on the Air with SSD. I purchased mine for just slightly more than my former MacBook Pro. And for me, it was definitely worth it.",5,Worth the price!,08/05/2008

Strumpf,"[38,40]","I've had my Macbook Air for over two weeks now and it continues to amaze me. I bought it to replace an almost 5 year old 17"" Powerbook and the first thing that struck me was how light it felt on my lap. It's almost like it isn't even there. I bought the 64 gig SSD version and the second thing that struck me was how cool the computer felt. Literally. My Powerbook would become uncomfortably hot after a while but the MBA remains cool the whole time I use it. This may be a function of the SSD not having any moving parts but it certainly is welcome, especially for prolonged web-browsing on the couch.Several other things make this my best laptop. First, it wakes up in a snap when I open the lid, although it does take a few seconds to find the wireless network. As others have mentioned, the screen is bright and absolutely gorgeous. I was a little nervous about these 52 year old eyes reading on the small screen but no problem at all so far. Watching downloaded movies and TV shows is a pleasure. The computer is plenty powerful for my needs. I use a laptop for web-surfing, watching videos, Office type applications and making presentations and the MBA is just fine for this. I have an Imac for heavier duty applications like Photoshop and video creation.Last week I flew with my MBA on commuter planes, the ultimate test for any laptop. It was great replacing my heavy Powerbook with something so light and easy to handle. I didn't do any work on the plane (I find it hard to work while flying) but I did watch videos and the computer opened up sufficiently to allow me to enjoy what I was watching. Plus it was easy to store under the seat for takeoff and landing. And as an added benefit, two flight attendants came up to me to ogle my MBA and chat with me. That never happened when I had a Dell!I bought the external DVD drive and used it to load some software. The lack of a built-in drive is no issue for me. Neither is the port ""shortage"". I've never had more than one USB device hooked up to a laptop at a time anyway and I don't need Firewire. So Apple's compromise is no compromise at all for me.So if your needs are like mine I'd urge you to strongly consider the MBA. It's pricey in my configuration- although I did get the 10% education discount available through Apple- but if you plan to keep it for years like I do it's less of an issue.

I started with the Mini Mac, buying a Mac Book and an i Mac in a short period afterwards and I cannot get my kids off them now at home!All that kept me going with a Windows system was I needed an ultra-portable laptop given my travel by air a lot and the Sony Vaio I had was fine for this purpose. With the launch of the Air I at last had the missing piece.After 6 weeks using with the 1.8 Ghz upgrade, I am very satisfied and suspect I will never be going back to Windows based laptops. I do not propose to repeat others comments on its features but would comment on a few aspects that any buyer should consider:1. The item as with all Apple models is beautifully designed. Be prepared to invest in a safety sleeve for travel and avoid scratching the aluminum cover - I found the Huzzk range the best for the job with their ""open up and zip around"" and rubber stud design cover design perfect for this model.2. The case being aluminum does get very heated especially when resting on top of your knees! Another reason for buying a travel sleeve and investing in one which is thick enough to help on this point - again a reason why the Huzzk range was my choice.3. The many comments on battery replacement are lacking in understanding that when traveling a lot the key is being able to carry and insert a spare battery. However technology moves on and I have offset this problem by investing in the portable Power Monkey kit which is both small and light plus provides several hours power if a mains supply is not available.4. On battery life the personal experience and many of the Apple magazine reviews are now also stating the same point, that the Apple batteries seem to take some time to build up to their maximum life/charge, so expect only just over a few hours in early days of portable usage. Whether it makes the 5 hours target remains to be seen but again the Power Monkey option addresses if needed.5. However much people rave about the looks and the great Leopard OS, be prepared to accept this is an ultra portable and so speed, performance and storage will not be as great as larger Macs (including the Mac Books at cheaper prices) - that is not a criticism just the reality. The beautiful screen and excellent size and feel keyboard however leave all other ultra portables (including Sony Vaio range) in the shade.Overall I am thus very satisfied and would strongly recommend this model long as you are happy with the above compromises - I just wish Apple in their publicity and claims would accept that in terms of comparability it cannot match the rest of their laptop range but as an ultra portable it is King versus the competition (hence my ""mistress"" title to this review!)",5,Brill (but a mistress not a master compared with other Apple laptops)!,05/27/2008

Place 2 fingers down and slide them up or down scrolls the page.It has been good for running games.  I have the 128MB video card in mine and seems to handle C&C; Generals and Half-Life2 with ease (via my boot camp partition running Windows).  I have even run C&C; Generals via a virtual machine, and it was certainly playable (though I had to turn some of the settings down to medium instead of high).  I haven't tried any other games at this point.  No doubt the 256MB model should handle things even better.Installing Windows via boot camp is a snap, and then installing some virtual machine software allows you have to Windows whenever you need it.  Run it side by side with OS X, or reboot into Windows natively.The worst part about this notebook is battery power.  With everything turned on and the screen brightness on high, the battery will only last 1.5, maybe 2 hours.  This isn't good for using on plane rides longer that that.  However, I was able to watch 2 movies in a row (approximately 4 hours) and still have some life left.  I accomplished this by ripping the movies to my hard drive (doing so saves power since it doesn't have to spin a DVD in the drive constantly during playback), disabling the wireless card, and lowering the brightness as low as possible.  Unfortunately I can't seem to control screen brightness when booting directly to Windows, so the battery life is much worse when running Windows.Apple just released a battery update in early October 2007.  It appears the battery life is better (I can now get about 3.5 hours with the brightness at about 50-60% when simply checking email, browsing the web etc.).  I'm very pleased with that update!There is very little learning curve if this is your first time using a Mac.  It's rock solid (in fact, the only application that seems to crash on me is MS Office), and rarely requires software updates (unlike Windows).

Computers, and especially laptops, are becoming cache's of personal life. What better way to trust our computing experience and organize our digital life, than to a good computer. You pay for what you get, and Mac's are the best.So if you want a laptop that is powerful (it's my all in one solution), simple to use, great battery life (a good solid 4 hours), reliable and secure, brilliant hi resolution screen, this is what you should go for.FYI, I'm a college student who used to be a Windows power user, and now that I use Mac, I don't have to worry about spyware and virus's anymore.

Franz,"[98,102]","My previous (non-Windows) laptop was a trusty 12"" G4 (""titanium""). I loved it, as it was (and still is) of an almost perfect size, and capable to do almost everything I needed to do on the road. But it *was* getting old, and when Apple came out with the slightly speedbumped MacBook Pro (a name I still don't like), I ordered it. I'm reviewing the 15"", 2.4 GHz, 2 GB, 200 GB hard drive version.The first thing that strikes you is how thin it is. My good old G4 was already slim, and the envy of almost every other passenger next to me. However, due to the increased screen size, the new MacBook Pro seems even slimmer (it actually *is* slightly slimmer than the G4 in case you wonder). What is really impressive is that the 12"" G4 weights nearly the same as the much larger (and newer) 15"" - that's progress! And the 12"" G4 is a lot lighter than my Wintel laptop.The next thing you notice is when you turn it on: the screen's brightness. I've purchased the matte screen, as I'm not really fond of glossy screens (reflections). Still, the (now LED backlit) screen is astonishingly bright, and bright enough to use outdoors on almost any occasion (except in direct sunlight on a sunny summer day). Contrast is good (even exceptional compared to my G4). The screen's resolution (1440x900) is great, and more than enough for most presentation, spreadsheet and word processing work. Since it's 16:9 aspect ratio, it is also great for most image processing (lots of space for your palettes). It is less well suited for coding, as it is not wide enough for two 'real' code windows side by side. Then again, the MacBook Pro comes with a graphics card that can drive an external (additional) 21"" monitor without breaking a sweat, and that *is* enough for most coding needs. I should note that Apple chose to make the video connector DVI (luckily a standard connector this time, unlike in my G4, where it is a proprietary connector), and omits a standard 'VGA' style connector. This means that, if you plan on giving a presentation, you should always bring along the DVI to VGA adapter (that Apple thankfully includes in the box).What I really enjoy about the MacBook Pro is it's selection interfaces. I have rather large amounts of data that I have to move in and out of it (from our production machines that do most of the heavy lifting), and having a FireWire 800 port is a godsend. Using Firewire networking, I can move gigabytes in minutes (limited, it seems, more by the laptop's hard drive than bandwidth). In addition to that, it sports a USB 2.0 (for connecting all those Wintel things, plus iPods), a FireWire 400 port (can be used with older Macs, and many HandyCams), and 802.11 (""Airport"") connectivity (b/g/n). Since the 'n' part of the 802.11 is not yet officially ratified, there aren't many hotspots that support it (unless you are lucky enough to be close to a new Apple Basestation).Sadly, it does not have a slot for memory cards (CF, SD, whatever), but since readers are really cheap today, that's not an issue. On the upside, it also comes with self-sensing Gigabit Ethernet, wich is something that is really important when you want to quickly connect the laptop to a wired high-speed network.The MacBook Pro also comes with a front-loading trayless DVD (DL) writer. It's not really fast, but it integrates nicely into the laptop, and is decidedly much, much cooler than those flimsy contraptions that I see sliding out of so many other laptops (my Dell included). I know that there are faster writers, but then again, if I want to write large amounts of data, I usually transfer them to a big box that can write at four times the speed.Temperature-wise the MacBook Pro shares the same problem as most recent laptops: it gets uncomfortably warm for something that is supposedly be used on your lap. I didn't get burned, but did not enjoy the sensation either. So, whenever possible, use a surface you can put it on instead of using it directly on your lap. Speaking of using it - the keyboard is very similar to the one built into my G4. It's OK, but nothing much to write home about (sorry, couldn't resist that pun). The keys are, however, backlit, which is a definite improvement (and looks really, really great). I still have mimxed feelings with regard to the trackpad. It supports the 'two-finger clicks' to simulate a two-button mouse and to implement scrolling, but I havn't much used it, opting for a small two-button mouse instead (purchased separately, and not from Apple).There are some other things that come with the MacBook, most notably the built-in iSight (which can't be physically disabled short of voiding your warranty), and a tiny remote. I don't plan to use either. Looking for some freebies on the disk, I discovered that Apple, too, had succumbed to pre-installing demo versions of (thankfully few) applications: MS Office, Aperture and iWork (Keynote and Pages). Freebies are Comic Life, iLife (iMovie, iTunes, iDVD, iWeb, Garageband), and Omni Outliner.It took me roughly 2 hours to completely configure the new laptop the way I wanted it (most of the time taken up by installing Parallels (with Windows XP taking 45 minutes), Final Cut Studio, XCode, Office, Aperture, Freeway, and iWork). I did not take advantage of the 'transfer from other Mac' feature (which I know to work well), because I wanted a freshly set up Mac. Still, compared to the time it took me to install and configure my last (Wintel) laptop, that is next to nothing. Network and Internet setup was a snap, and didn't require much more beyond adding it to our Firewall's 'good guy' list. I then took it on a road trip over the week-end.I'm happy to say that it passed the trip-test easily. The 'mag-safe' power adapter is definitely more than just a gadget, but also definitely less than revolutionary. It came off twice during the week-end, but both times a normal power adapter would not have snapped. The second time it came off I only noticed because the screen dimmed immediately (to conserve power, as per energy settings).I never worked with it off the normal power for longer than two hours, so I don't know how realistic Apple's figures are. The battery pack does come with one of those cool green LED charge meters, and after two hours they indicated about 50% charge left (as did the on-screen meter). Working with the MacBook Pro was always good, with all applications being very responsive (except, of course MS Office, as my version is not Universal. It was responsive enough for serious work, though). The wireless antenna seems slightly more sensitive than that from my old G4, but still can't hold a candle against reception in most PC laptops with low-cost (and sometimes drop-dead ugly) WiFi adapters. This may be caused by the metallic casing. BlueTooth reception, on the other hand, is good, and proved no problem with any of the bluetooth devices I tried (well -- I only have two: my phone, and my car).All in all I'm very happy with my new laptop, prefer it immensely over my Windows-based laptop (which, now that I have an Intel-based Mac, I can safely store in the attic and return it for the regular company-sponsored upgrades), and only feel slightly guilty of purchasing over my old (but still working) G4. The screen size and brightness, the connectivity, and the incredible slickness of the form factor make this a great laptop. It's really a hot laptop. The only downside is that it is also literally a hot laptop, but not more than my Windows-based laptop from Dell. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a slick, high-end laptop.",5,"Great product, only tiny flaws",06/25/2007

Excellent screen. OS never crashes! Fully integrated bash terminal is great---it provides seamless connectivity to other linux-based systems. Magnetic power cable connection works fantastic. Fewer viruses are written for Macs.Cons: Mostly about OS X and user interface. Hard to get used for long-time Windows users. Even after getting used to it, it lacks some important features Windows provides by default.  File manager (Finder) is poorly designed--moving files around is a big pain. Lack of home/end/insert/delete buttons on the keyboard is a big minus. Clicking the touchpad requires quite a bit of force. Choosing large areas of text via touchpad is not easy (you need to push the hard touchpad and move your finger for pages!).  IMO, ""minimize all"" in Windows works much better than expose.In principle, one can install Windows on a Mac. However, Mac laptops are designed to work with OS X (e.g. there's no 2nd, 3rd buttons on the touchpad, and no trackball for scrolling, no home/end/insert/delete buttons etc). Running windows on a Mac has its own inconveniences and it's not preferable by design.Verdict: For me, the laptop would be exceptional if it were designed to run Windows.

Boot Camp works splendidly and my copy of Windows XP that runs in that partition is stable and fast.Configuration was pure pleasure.  OS X 10.5.2 came preinstalled.  With the included Migration Assistant I was able to move an image of my old PowerBook to the new MacBook Pro via FireWire 800 -- all automatically.  It was slick.  When the job was done, all of my programs and data were on the computer and everything looked just as it had on the old one.About the only configuration hangup I had was that I had to find and rerun the driver installation program for my Oki C5300 network color laser printer in order to install the printer on the new box.  But once I did, setting up the printer was easy.  All in all this was the easiest time I have ever had configurating a new computer -- by a bunch.Those of you who are current pre-G5 PowerPC Mac owners should not be put off by having to run your old PowerPC apps on a new Mac box with an Intel chip.  Apple's Rosetta program, which is built into OS X for the purpose, runs PowerPC apps fast and seamlessly.  I am running Microsoft Office X for OS X, which I bought for my old PowerBook and all of its programs thbat I use, Word, Excell, and Entourage, seem to run at least as fast on the new computer as they did on the old one.I decided to buy the 2.4Ghz model because it was on closeout, plus Amazon offered a $150 check to those who bought one.

Picht,"[66,71]","Let me stress at the beginning that I am not a Mac fanatic. I work with PCs and find them much less annoying now than I did 10 and 20 years ago. I've owned an iMac for four years and find it nice but imperfect. Macs and PCs are converging when it comes to reliability and ease of use, but Apple products are much more elegantly designed than most other computer products, and the Mac OS is still cleaner and more stable than Microsoft's product. I doubt the price premium makes Macs worth it for everyone, and in some ways Apple computers are like luxury cars that aren't designed either for stellar performance or to make things easy for the home mechanic, but rather to make driving as easy and comfortable as possible for people who don't much care to change their own spark plugs. They aren't for everyone, but they're definitely for those of us who want things easy and want our toys to have some style.I like my new MacBook very, very much. It's thin, light, clean, and oh, so simple to use. The screen is brilliant, the keyboard feels nice (and I love the back-lit keys). Without subscribing to a service or dealing with any settings, I turned it on and had immediate wireless access to the Internet. I plugged my camera into it and immediately downloaded pictures - no mess, no software to install. The included software that loads and edits pictures, music, and video is all nicely integrated and very easy to use, and also more than adequate for the casual user. I'm a little more than a casual user of photo software and will install Photoshop, but for most of my pictures I'll probably stick with iphoto. I popped in the disc for my four-year-old version of Office for the Mac and in a few minutes had smoothly functioning word-processing and spreadsheet software running the files I brought in from my office PC. Easy, easy, easy.(This does lead me to note a negative that isn't minor: Apple computers used to come with a decent word processing and spreadsheet package, AppleWorks. That's no longer included. If you want to do word processing, you must buy some other software to do it. The absence of AppleWorks is unfortunate.)I bought this computer for my wife (yes, I called it mine - she may have to pry it from my hands) and opted for the MacBook Pro over the regular MacBook. She plans to use it on her sabbatical this year, toting it around to various libraries and archives and writing a book. I tried out my brother's MacBook and liked it very much, but I think the MacBook's chicklet keyboard would be annoying and uncomfortable if I had to type long or quickly on it. If this computer weren't destined to be used for long keyboard sessions away from home, I'd have been happy with the MacBook. If it were destined to be used mostly at home, I'd have saved a few hundred dollars and just bought a plug-in keyboard. But for our purposes the better keyboard and brighter screen really matter, so I spent the extra money on the Pro. If you don't plan to do a lot of typing, or if you plan to use it mostly at home, I don't think the extra expenditure would really be worth it.As another reviewer pointed out, this thing gets hot. Very hot. I've always found laptop computers to be a bit warm for laptops, but this one would be painful on unprotected flesh. The magnetic connection for the power cable is very nice. The battery life isn't bad, nor is it great - surfing the net and word processing, I've managed a bit over four hours. I haven't watched an entire DVD on it, but that seems to drain the battery more quickly. The kids have already videoconferenced with their grandparents, and the built-in camera is very nice for that.Overall, this computer reminds me of my iPod - sleek, sexy, uncomplicated but sophisticated, fun to be with.

Definitely not worth the premium paid.",1,MacBook Pro,03/14/2008

I was very hesitant to order a glossy screen, especially after my niece's husband tried to steer me away from the glossy screen.  But he's a PC user, and several reviewers said that a PC glossy screen is different than a Mac glossy screen.I would say that must be true, because I'm not merely satisfied with the glossy screen, I'm very GLAD that I got it.  The picture is so much better than my iBook that every time I have to use the iBook (while I was transferring all my files, and while I was wiping it clean and setting it up for my husband), I can't wait to get back to my MBP.I have used it throughout my home in different lighting conditions, and at Panera, and it has been fine - better than the iBook.  What other reviewers have said is true - if there is any glare at all, you just tilt the screen a quarter-inch one way or the other and there's no more glare.  This is true even while I'm sitting with our bright living room windows behind me.  When I was at Panera with windows surrounding me on three sides and overhead lights, there was a little more glare than at home - but MUCH BETTER visibility than I ever got there with my iBook.I haven't used it in an office environment, but I have used it at home with overhead lighting, and tilting the screen a quarter-inch has solved any glare problem.  Plus, the screen can be made so much brighter than my iBook, that makes a huge difference in visibility in a high-light environment.I love everything else about my MBP - the better screen resolution, the backlit keyboard, the speakers, the speed of the processor (even though it's only a 2.2 GHz), and everything else.  I can't believe how much more screen space I have with a 15.4 inch screen (I had a 14-inch iBook) - it really does make a significant difference.The only thing I don't like is the position of the USB port and the firewire port on the right side.  I use my computer on a lapdesk with a mouse, and the position of this port makes that impossible while I have something plugged into it.",5,Glossy screen on MacBook Pro,07/21/2008

There are much better laptops available. Be aware the price offered here at Amazon by third party dealers is not the cheapest available. Apple sells it for less than the current price shown. The strongest thing going for the system is it's operating system which gives a brief breath of fresh air from the coldness found in Windows. There is also a strong community of users who will help you out and a friendly customer service team.The main issues are a screen which is horrific. Apple can no longer be known for graphics. The maximum resolution found on the screen is less than other models sold by their competitors. This is how this system was designed. Investigate.The MacBook Pro screens have a defect affecting most of the production currently. The lower 1/3 of the screen will have a yellowish/golden hue. The very top of the monitor has a 1mm bright white line. The tones from top to bottom are inconsistent. The screens background helps to mask the problem but you will see it if you ever do any work with the system.The viewing angle is very narrow. If your head leaves a 4 inch box the screen is almost unreadible and will be golden in color. This is due to the ""LED"" backlighting system. Investigate.If you are still intent on an Macbook look at the 17 inch model. You will notice the 17"" is the most commonly reviewed model because the other ones will be horribly received. It does not use the LED backlighting and the maximum resolution is higher.The second main issue is something Mac users are referring to as ""Kernel panic"". It is the same thing as Microsoft's notorius ""blue screen of death""except the cause is the hardware. Should your system have ""kernel panic"" you will have a locked up, unusable system. The work will have gone unsaved and you will be out of the notebook for 3 weeks as they repair the brand new system. Investigate this further.Yes, stick a fork in it.

Apple just rocks when it comes to design of their products...I like unix OS derivatives, I would have gone for a lenovo and installed linux on it, but mac seemed like a one stop shop though bit expensive compared to the other... maybe the beauty of the notebook made me buy it.One of the driving reasons to buy mac was leopard OS, it has cool features, great to get yourself organized. However I still don't miss the application crash as that on windows pc, everyday I end up sending 4-5 crash reports to apple... thankfully the OS itself never crashed.I love the booting time of leopard, it is amazing fast compared to windows. I never have to leave the notebook in sleep mode, whenever u want just switch it on and boom it's ready to use... save some power ;)Though applications crash quite often, they run amazingly fast... thanks to intel core 2 processor and 2GB RAM on board. The processing experience is just amazing.I am not too fascinated about the usability of touchpad in mac... to scroll use two fingers (give me a break!!!) and for context menu double tap... I just feel it is stupid.The notebook gets awfully heated, other notebooks I had earlier were far better in this aspect... I rate just one star when it comes to this.

I've had this MBP for 3 weeks now.  The first unit I got had a faulty number ""2"" key on the keyboard.  I had it replaced and the store gave me a brand new one right after testing it.  He said it rarely happens for a mac to have faulty keyboard.  I bought the MBP right after the Leopard was released, hoping the Leopard would come preinstalled.  But it came with Tiger instead and has a drop in kit in the box.  It took me over 2 hours to upgrade to Leopard.I won't take time to do what others have done; I'll briefly just go over some of the features I hope it could improve/should have included.  Let's face it, it is a $2500 retail laptop, it should come with a lot of features not found on a sub $1000 laptop computer:1. louder speaker (louder and better low end sound) (some Toshiba and HP has much better sound than the MBP)2. even though I probably won't use it, but a finger print security scanner would be nice3. more USB ports (I think it has room for at least 2 more)4. better cooling, it gets so hot after a while it became not laptop-able.5. longer battery life (it gets about 3.5-4 hours now.  With the technology improvements on other aspects of the computer industry, I think it should be at least 5-6 hour range for even DVD movie playing.)6. higher megapixel for the built-in camera. (it's only 2.0MP now)7. upgrade option for 512M video card (it's only 256M now)One week after I bought it, Apple offered the option to upgrade to 2.6GHz for another $250.  I didn't think the 0.2GHz was worth $250 so I didn't go back to the store to get it exchanged again.I play a lot of music on my MBP that's why I really thought the speaker quality was not good enough.  Of course one could always add another external PC speaker, but I am just comparing to what I heard on other Toshiba or HP laptops in the same size/price range.Overall:  Highly recommended.",4,Almost a perfect laptop...,11/18/2007

Why?  Because after 35 years of computer operation I had yet to ever own an apple, or even operate one for more than a half hour at a time while borrowing a friend's when I was traveling.After only two hours of setting up my brand new incredible machine, and playing around a little bit with it (yes, I actually used the book and mostly the help icon), I am beside myself with thrilledness.  This is by far the fastest, nicest, easiest to use machine I have operated in 35 years.  I LOVE the dashboard!  I've already configured it with 8 of my special websites, including my stocks.  A split second and it all appears on the screen.Really I can't say enough about this machine.  I read that someone was uncomfortable with the heat produced by the battery but the only time I noticed that was the very first time I charged it up.  Now even while charging the temperature is not uncomfortable.  And one of the best parts?  The life of the battery puts my former Dell computers to absolute shame!I had ordered another Dell with the VISTA operating system a couple of months ago.  VISTA was so bad (in less than two weeks it was stalling on me, along with numerous other problems) that I returned the computer for a full refund ........ and spent a tad bit more money buying this incredible MacBook Pro.My recommendation for anyone who's checking these out is this:  don't skimp on the fun stuff, like extra high speed RAM.  I put 3 gigs into mine of high speed and might even add 1 more gig as it is so awesome to play with something this fast.

I have used windows computers since 1998 and finally I decided to see if all the hype about Mac OS X was true.  Mac OS X is a great system to work with.  It is secure, stable and simple to use.  For instance, when I am typing a paper  or playing a game, I don't think about the computer, I just think about the game, paper or whatever else it is I am doing.  With windows, I was constantly being interrupted with error messages or notifications that I would think more along the lines of, I'm typing a paper...on a computer.  Also, I have had my mac on for about 8 days now without a restart and it is still running smoothly.  With windows, I would have to restart sometimes multiple times in a day.  If are like I was, and considering a switch to Mac OS X, but still need to run Windows XP or Vista, you can do so via bootcamp, vmware, or parallels.  I personally use bootcamp for gaming and parallels for productivity tasks (Microsoft Publisher, etc.).  Parallels can boot to your bootcamp partition, so you don't have to waste disk space with two windows installations.  On average, my battery lasts for about 3 1/2 hours with display at about max, airport turned on, and running word, ichat, mail, and surfing internet with firefox.  So far I only have two complaints about this machine.  1st is that my airport wireless signal drops every so often.  To get it back I have to disable the airport card and then enable it a few seconds later.  According to Apple, they are working on a fix for this issue.  A side note, Apple customer service in my opinion is one of the best in the industry.  I had a great experience with them when explaining my airport issue.  The other thing I have noticed is the computer runs a little warmer than other notebooks I have used.  In my opinion, it is not extremely hot (you won't burn yourself), but it is a little warmer than I would have expected, but at an inch thick, what did you expect?

Although both the OS and the laptop itself are excellent products, I can't help but glance from time to time at my Dell Inspiron for answers whenever I get stuck in a rut. With that in mind, I'll draw some comparisons between my 14"" Inspiron and the MB Pro.Here's my two cents:HARDWARE:* Peripherals:I think that for $2,000+ I should get at least 3 USB ports instead of  just 2. The Inspiron comes with 4 at $1,500 and not even the 17"" model comes close with only 3 USB ports available. Both the MB Pro come with Express Card slots but the Inspiron comes with a 5-card memory reader. Granted, the MB Pro comes with an extra FWire slot but I still haven't found a good use for it. A memory reader would be sweet, though!* Keyboard/Trackpad:I'll say it up front: I do not like the keyboard's response! The keys feel kind of mushy and the kick-back action is slow which keeps me from typing fast. The backlit function is super sweet, though! It really comes in handy when I use it in a non-lit room... it also attracts the attention of passersby which is always cool hehe. BUT, this very function messes up the key's assigned functions (Spaces, Dashboard, Expos&eacute;, etc...) which makes it a toss-up between choosing either the Expos&eacute; functions or the Volume/Brightness functions. In this aspect, I prefer the Dell's response but backlit LED feature is not available.The trackpad is nice and big enough for mouse activity but sometimes gets in the way of my typing and can mess up with my typing especially when I have to reach out to the G, H, V, B and M keys.*LCD:The LCD is nice and bright and self-adjusts its brightness when in a low-light environment. Its tricky getting used to it because sometimes it will self-adjust to very low levels and you'll then have to manually tweak it until you're satisfied. I haven't had any monitor problems like other users have stated and I hope I don't run into that problem!*Speakers:I can't really say much about the speakers except that I like their location which is at either side of the keyboard and thus gets out of your way when you lay your wrists on the laptop. The sound quality and volume are OK and really don't use them since I either plug my headphones or my external speakers. I can say that they're more powerful than the Inspiron's.*Battery Life:The battery life on the MB Pro is great, running at an average of 4 hours which will vary depending on how much stuff you do with the laptop. Inspiron's battery life runs at an average of 3 hours.*Heat:Oh, yes... the dreaded subject! This annoying bug takes the ""lap"" out of ""laptop"" unless you enjoy your thighs being subject to extreme heat... I kid you not! I can only stand holding the MB Pro on my lap for about 30 minutes and then it just gets unbearable; I either have to set it on a table or turn it off and wait for it to cool down. It seems that the sleek design comes at a very high cost and that's the heat since only one cooling vent is found where the LCD meets the chassis. The Inspiron handles this issue with better results.*Weight/Size/Design:The MB Pro will fit just fine on my backpack which was designed to carry my 15"" Inspiron and the weight is nothing to either complain or brag about.The design WILL make heads turn since its aluminum casing (also a con. See: Heat) makes it look cool, sleek and just brings the whole design together since it's not splashed with several colors like other laptops do.SOFTWARE:I have to admit that I almost returned the damn thing since Leopard was not pre-installed as ""stated"" on the Apple website; Apple had adroitly phrased their Leopard marketing pitch as ""Ships with Leopard"". Oh but Leopard was included all-right, in a drop-in DVD.Upgrading was a breeze (around 40 minutes) and I didn't have to go back to the laptop every minute for annoying ""Would you like to..."" pop-ups. I can say that Leopard didn't recognize my wireless connection until after the computer was all setup.I can honestly say that Leopard is a great piece of software and its features (too many to discuss here) really blow Vista and/or XP out of the water; there's simply no point of comparison! And no, the OS is not perfect either. It will lock up but not as often as Windows... in fact, it has only locked up 3 times since I got the laptop on Nov 24 and I use it every day.I have really learned to enjoy the difference between platforms and although they're both flawed systems, OS X is the winner in this category. Who says you can't be productive and look cool at the same time!Bottom line, I don't have any reason to go back to Windows...er, well actually I do have XP installed thanks to VM Ware Fusion, which rocks by the way! Ok then, let me rephrase: I don't see myself buying a PC unless some major development happens in the hardware scene. Sony, HP, Dell, Toshiba... I'm talking to you!As for the software side, if a major release of Windows happens to be ground-breaking I'll just buy the damn thing and install it on my Mac, ha!I do have some suggestions though: I honestly believe a memory card reader is needed and don't give me the ""oh but you can buy an express card for that purpose"" excuse! The heat issue is a big one too: it's like having a Ferrari and not being able to get the juice out of it because the steering wheel gets hot after 30 minutes! The keyboard needs some work, it can be more responsive; the backlit feature rocks though!",4,Excellent laptop... although flawed,01/07/2008

I've owned laptops since 1985 and am not easily impressed, but the MacBook Pro elicited my admiration, at least until I tried to connect to my wireless DSL. The internal AirPort card recognized my 2WIRE DSL modem/router, but when I entered my security code, it wouldn't connect. Never had a problem with my Fujitsu Lifebook P2120. I even got a six year old ThinkPad running Windows 98 and a Linksys PCMCIA card to connect. After extensive research, I discovered from online forums that Apple's last software update to the AirPort card makes it impossible to connect with many wireless routers, not just 2WIRE's.I purchased an Airport Express and connected it to my 2WIRE through their ethernet ports and the MacBook now connects wirelessly to the Airport Express without problems.

Mac is my new favorite at school :) It's a lot smoother and simpler than Windows and the programs that are preinstalled (and FREE!) are amazing to say the least :) When ordering this product, the only ""built in"" option I'd say you absolutely NEED is the speed upgrade from ""5400 rpm"" to ""7200 rpm"". If money is not an issue for you, then of course I'd recommend buying ALL the options lol, but if you have a budget (like most of us)...REASON (for purchasing speed upgrade): As you gradually save more information/programs on your laptop (whether it's a Mac OR PC)... you will start to see a decrease in speed on your system. With the upgrade, as your computer slows down it will then eventually become as fast as it would've been in the first place WITHOUT the upgrade. Yes, you could always purchase the doubled memory (preinstalled is $700/separate is $500) OR you could save your specific files on USB memory drives! Maybe it's only because I'm a student... but I've discovered it's easier to save all my documents/pictures/videos/web history for each class on these drives (and it also develops my organization skills! lol). I have 6 classes and with 2GB USBs at $20 each that's only $120.By doing this, the only thing slowing down your computer will be programs you later install or download... and the decrease in your system's speed will occur 1/2 as quickly than if you'd been saving EVERYTHING on it.If you're interested in any other information I can give you about this (or any computer), email me at RachelLMayo@gmail.com :) I'd be more than happy to help!",4,Great product... read review for why :),09/11/2007

When Apple updated the MacBook Pros with a better processor, better graphics, more system ram and led-backlighting, shortly after the birth of our daughter (the selling point to my wife was that I would be better able to edit videos and whatnot of the kiddo), the timing was just right.  I've been a longtime DOS/Windows user - and now I feel like some kind of refugee - fleeing PC for a Mac OS X world and I couldn't be happier - although it's not without its adjustments.I originally wrote this review for the 15"", 2.4 gHz, middle of the line MacBook Pro.  However, Amazon has set this review to appear for all three models in the line, which can make it confusing.  I've tried to edit it some to make it clear what the differences are between the models.  Also, now that Amazon has actually added extensive product information for the MBP, I'll try to take out some of my initial information on specs that is now redundant.There remain three models in the line and the price points for each of those models has remained the same from the previous generation.- 15"" models now have an LED backlit screen, 17"" models do NOT (as of yet).  Some folks think you have a better rendition of black in the screen - I'm not sure if it is better or not, but it is gorgeous.  In the store, it appeared to me that the new screen (as viewed on the 15"") was brighter than the older screen type (which is still on the 17"").  The LED screen initially appeared washed out in the lighting of the Apple store, but I then realized that at full brightness, it can have that effect - turning down the brightness (who ever heard of that) - took away the washed out look.- Apple says that using LED's (instead of flourescent tubes) uses less power, generates less heat, provides more range of brightness and more even lighting.  This would appear to be true in practice as well as theory.  Battery life is good and the lighting of the screen (as noted above) is quite bright and appears to be very even.  As for heat, I really haven't checked the screen temps, but the computer itself does not run as hot as I thought it would (based on reviews of prior generations).  It is warm, but not at all uncomfortable to have on my lap (with the caveat that I have not done a lot of processor intensive work as of yet).  Oddly enough, Apple states above that the display is mercury-free, but the box label says that the screen contains mercury - it may well just be a label update glitch.- These models are MATTE screen.  If you want GLOSSY you'll need to order from Apple or pick one up at their store (I did).  I have heard that the glossy is actually more readable outdoors than the matte, but I have yet to confirm this for myself.  That said, I've had no viewability issues in widely varied lighting conditions of my office (which is pretty bright, with overhead lighting and lots of exterior light) and my house (which is largely the opposite).- The system runs well (or so it seems) with 2 GB, but I am upgrading to 4 GB (the sticks are on their way - but not from Apple - way overpriced).- the 17"" and higher-end 15"" get 256 MB of video ram, 128 MB in the lower-end 15"" model - most folks are probably fine with 128 MB as it is the change in the graphics processor here that is truly the big news in performance. On the other hand, the extra video ram may give you the feeling of being a little bit more future-proofed and may be more helpful for hardcore gamers and people who are driving large external displays. I opted for the 256 MB.- hard drive is a very nice 160GB, 5400 RPM Fujitsu drive in the 17"" and higher-end 15"".  The lower-end MacBook Pro hard drive is a 120GB, 5400RPM Drive - this, oddly, is smaller than the 160 GB drive that is in the top line MacBook that is several hundred dollars less.  I'll probably add an external Firewire 800 drive for the video work I want to do.- processor speed gets a minor upgrade to 2.4 gHz (from 2.33, or to 2.2 from 2.16 for the lower-end 15"" model - but this is the new Santa Rosa processor - with a faster bus speed of 800 mHz (although the memory speed remains at a max of 667 mHz).For $500 less, the lower-end 15"" model has 128 MB of video ram (instead of 256), a 2.2 gHz Santa Rosa processor (.2 slower) and a 120 GB hard drive.  However, it still retains the other upgrades, including the 4 GB maximum system memory and the LED backlit screen and seems to be an excellent bargain as most of the differences appear reasonably nominal.  That said, I chose to go with the higher end 15"" version - I probably don't need it, but I plan to do a fair amount of video editing and perhaps some high resolution projection - warranting the slightly faster processor and more video ram) - and I'm also somewhat neurotic and unlikely to second guess having made the higher end choice.  At least I can admit it.A friend of mine asked why I didn't get the MacBook for a thousand dollars less.  For me, the screen-size was not so much an issue, but I feel that twice the maximum ram, the separate graphics processing unit, the Firewire 800, the ExpressCard slot (if I wanted to add a CDMA or GSM-based wireless connection card) and the LED screen was well worth the difference.Perhaps it goes without saying, but the computer itself seems well-built and well-engineered - but it's all relative and it's not hard to be a better, more integrated product than most windows-based pc's.  The MBP replaces an older Toshiba laptop for me - and there's really no point in even trying to make a comparison, it's a joke.  The Mac O/S is a bit of a learning curve for me - but more like I am trying to unlearn ""bad habits"" from Windows - things now make sense in an operational and functional manner.  Overall, it's an attention to detail that I really appreciate on both the hardware and the software side - little things like a backlit, auto-dimming keyboard or the magnetic power connector.  I have to admit though, that after initially being impressed by the light-sensing, auto-dimming screen - I am annoyed by the fact that the sensor is apparently in the keyboard and, in a bright room, certain hand movements cause the screen brightness to change back and forth.  I'll probably turn off the feature because of this.",5,A very nice update to the MacBook Pro,06/05/2007

You have the option of buying a glossy or a standard display, and there is a big difference.  The colors on the glossy display are outstanding and if your primary goal is to look are photographs, glossy may be your best choice.  But glossy displays reflect light from the room, and many people (including me) get headaches if they use the notebook for a few hours in a well-lit room.  In contrast, the macbook with the standard display has excellent color but the blacks are not as black and the whites are not quite as white.  I have both, and vastly prefer the standard display when I have a lot of work to do.  I will never get a glossy display again and unless you know what you are doing, I strongly recommend you avoid a glossy screen as well.",5,"Excellent, but you probably do NOT want a glossy display",05/20/2008

Vista has the opposite effect of upgrading due to its increase in speed/ram requirements, and laptops running at the required speed and ram (2+ GHz and 4G ram seem average) cost a pretty penny more than desktops.  So I will leave Vista for the desktops, but I'm loving my Macbook Pro.  The features that are uber nice are: break-away power plug, already had to use this feature multiple times!  Blue tooth included (at least in this model), and backlit keyboard.  You'd have to really pay some change to get these with a standard Vista-based laptop.  Not to mention, this laptop WILL run Windows XP if I decided to go back.  Overall, I'm impressed with the OS and how everything (including utility software) is included from the start and how it is integrated into the OS.  Very nice.  Also, the thing doesn't make a noise most of the time.",5,"Love it, rock solid performance",04/05/2008

I can't describe how happy I am to have a portable computer.Design:The first thing you will notice when you see the Macbook Pro is design. From the battery to the iSight camera there isn't one thing that is not completely thought out. Apple has always been known for their deign, but this is their best design so far. When you look at any other laptop brand there are ugly colors and a non uniform case. The Macbook Pro is completely silver with smooth edges and parallel lines. The Macbook Pro is beautiful.Performance:The Macbook Pro is the fastest laptop I have ever used. With and Intel Core 2 Duo processor this laptop flies. Whether I'm compressing a Movie in Final Cut Express or importing photos into iPhoto it is light years ahead of what my G5 would do. What would take my 3 minutes to do on my iMac takes my 1 minute to do on the Pro. It is extremely fast.Leopard:With the new operating system leopard this is a start of the art computer. My favorite features in Leopard are actually some of the small ones. I absolutely love Spaces. I have different spaces for Mail, Safari, iChat, and then one empty space for any other application, like Final Cut Express. I also like the RSS reader in Mail. Instead of going online and checking Safari, Mail will just tell me what RSS feeds are updated. iChat screen sharing is also amazing. Me friend Chandler and I often will control each other Macbook Pro just to see what each of us is doing. While the image quality isn't the best, that isn't expected with the 64 bit operating system streaming over the web. I haven't had a chance to try Time Machine yet, but when I do I will tell you about it.iLife 08:iLife is has always been great, but with 08 they made it even better. I will explain my top feature in each application.iPhoto: I really don't use iPhoto that much, but my favorite feature in iPhoto 08 is events. Now when you import your photos, they go into ""event"" lists. It is a great way to organize your photos. For instance I can put all of my Christmas pictures into an event and my band picture into another.iWeb: I can't just pick one feature from iWeb. I have two. The first is the ability to put Google Adsense directly into your website. Now you can make money directly from .Mac. My second favorite feature is the ability to upload using FTP to your own server. That is what I've been waiting for, and now I might use it to update my [...] website.Garageband:My favorite feature in Garageband is ""Magic Garageband."" WIth Magic Garageband you can select a style of music and then change instruments and sounds and make your own song off a preloaded one Apple has made for you. I can now make great songs, easily. The best parts is as always everything is royalty free. So you can put the songs into your own movies.iMovie:Sadly I think iMovie 08 is a downgrade form earlier versions, but I'll tell you about that later. My favorite feature in iMovie 08 is the direct upload to Youtube. You can click a button and then it will publish your movie to Youtube. Now, the reason I say that it is a downgrade is because they have stripped all of the main features out of it. Th effects, and timeline are all gone. Yes it is easier, but there are not a lot of good editing features. At least iMovie HD can co-exist on the same operating system, and Apple offers it as a free download. As for me, I got Final Cut Express and it is great.Overall:I absolutely love my new Macbook Pro and the software that comes with it.Tim HermansonEmail me: funnyent@gmail.com",5,Macbook Pro!,02/06/2008

I really am enjoying OS X.  There are a few things about using it that are taking some time to learn, but for the most part it just works.  It is speedy and easy to setup.  I also love the external look of the laptop, but it has some definite issues and is sadly lacking in areas.What I Love:- Initial setup was really, really easy.- Connecting to wireless* networks and bluetooth has been a cinch- It is speedy- I am able to run VMWare Fusion on it and install a Windows virtual machine.  Likewise, I can set up dual boot.**- It looks cool- Long battery life- The back lighting on the keyboard- Very nice display qualityWhat I Hate:- It looks cool, but the aluminum is actually really annoying in every day use.  When you first pick it up, it is cold and somewhat unpleasant to the touch.  After a bit of use on your lap, it gets hotter than any laptop I've ever owned.  Almost too hot to touch!- *The wireless connection seems to be a bit flaky.  I've tried many things, but it just isn't very good.  I've done a lot of searching on Google and Apple support where it appears that this is a somewhat common problem with this laptop.- No memory card reader.  It would be really nice to have an SD memory card reader built in so that I didn't have to go fishing around for the USB cable to connect my camera to the laptop all the time.- The LCD lid doesn't open quite wide enough.  The design of it prevents it from opening as wide as I'd like it when I'm holding it on my lap.- All the ports are on the sides (not on back) and there is no easy single connector docking port on it.  This makes this laptop a real pain to plug in to an external monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, etc on a regular basis and even when you do, you have a lot of unsightly cables shooting out from the sides.  This seems to be a rather big oversight on a system that is deemed ""Pro"".  I don't see why they couldn't provide something like what HP has on their laptops for docking.- You pay significantly more for this laptop than you would for a similarly configured Windows laptop from HP or Dell (though they can't run OS X due to Apple licensing constraints)**.BOTTOM LINE:I'd buy this laptop again only because I wanted both OS X (Mac) and Windows.  Otherwise, it would be too pricey and the external functional aspects of it are too disappointing (for the price).You want this laptop if:- You want to look cool- You need to use OS X and Windows (just use VMWare Fusion or boot camp)- You want an operating system that is fast- You are willing to learn a little different way of working on a computer than Windows.You DON'T want this laptop if:- You are looking for an inexpensive solution and you don't need a Mac- You want to play games that only run on Windows unless you are willing to set up and maintain both OS X and Windows.- You are sensitive to external laptop temperatures (hot or cold on your lap).- You are expecting an OS that never fails and applications never have problems.  I'm sorry, but the Mac has issues too.  All software has issues from time to time and if you don't believe Macs have problems then just search Google or Apple for something like ""macbook crashes"".",3,"OS X Fantastic, but external functionality lacking despite high price",12/11/2007

At work I am using XP, on my Vaio I had XP and Vista (for two months). XP is OK but after my Vista experience the Mac OS X is such a relief.I have Tiger on my MBP and I will upgrade it to Leopard. Just watch the ""Leopard - Guided Tour"" on Apple's website and you will wonder why do people torture themselves with Windows?The design the speed, and the build quality of this laptop is great. I upgraded the RAM to 4GB - it took only 5 minutes - I found a good deal on Amazon. I have no issues with the screen (Matte - LG panel).Pros:- Mac OS X- Great preinstalled software package you don't have to waste your time with uninstalling the junk like on a windows laptop.- Size / Weight compared to other 15.4 laptops- everything regarding to the operation - fast, quiet, illuminating keyboard, magsafe power adapter ...- multiple options to install other operating system - I have Bootcamp / XP on it I only use it for my games.- I found all the other softwares that I needed for Mac.- wide range of custom designed accessories - you can spend a fortune on these :-)Cons:- only 2 USB ports- no multimedia card reader- no docking possibility- can be hot - I would recommend iLap that will solve the problem- fingerprint reader would be nice on a $2500 laptopMy conclusion:I don't take away stars for the cons because I knew all these things before I ordered my MBP and there weren't unexpected problems.

I was a life long Windows user that switched to Mac.  I've used various Macs in the past and had become pretty familiar with OS X....but this is the first Apple I've personally owned.  Having said that....OS X is so powerful it makes the computing life so much easier.  I believe many PC users that ""hate"" Apple are more afraid of changing than actually having a reason to dislike Apple.Anyways...  My only complaint about the MBP is the screen resolution.  On the 15 inch version the resolution is a native 1440x900.  At first I was a bit put off by this--but considering how crisp and bright the LCD screen is I was willing to operate at the ""lower"" resolution.  I went from my previous laptop's resolution of 1280x1050 to 1440x900 and after a few days I'm pretty happy.  Still the question remains as to why Apple would limit you to this lower resolution.Everything else about the MBP is top notch.  At first I thought the aluminum casing would be to delicate for everyday use--but fortunately the casing seems to be bulletproof.  It doesn't seem to fingerprint or scratch easily at all.All in all you cannot go wrong with the MBR.  If you think, as I did, that the lower resolution would be a deterrent to taking the step into Apple's world--don't be.  At the very least go look at this beautiful LED driven screen and see what you're missing...or should I say not going to miss?",5,MACBOOK PRO DELIVERS IN ALMOST EVERY WAY,12/27/2007

It is fast, powerful and can even handle some mid range games you throw at it (provided you are using Boot Camp). I bought this with the intention of using Aperture 2 and Final Cut and it has served well to that purpose ever since I bought it. In that regard, this product should have received 4 stars.Now the reason why I gave it a 4. It is my belief that merchants such as Amazon should make the shopping and deliberating process of buying an expensive item such as a laptop as easy as possible. It was easy enough to find all of the MBPs offered by Amazon, but it became quite hard to distinguish between which model offered what and which model lacked a certain feature. I even called Amazon CSR to verify to see if this was indeed the model with multi-touch and was told that it was. Of course, upon receiving the product, I realized that it was not. Too lazy to deal with returns, nor did I think it was really necessary, I just forgot about it. But the important thing to take away is that the Amazon CSR basically read off the description page and knew almost nothing of what I was asking. It might be better if I had done some more research but I was pressed for time. I recommend anyone buying similar items (ie. different models of MBP) to do additional outside research or hope that Amazon will put up a comparison feature within their web page.But let me be clear, this product is near perfect.

It seems well made, is  powerful and most importantly OS X is a much better thought out OS than Vista and generally better supported than Linux.
